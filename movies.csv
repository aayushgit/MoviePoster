I read the reviews. I knew it was terrible. But deep down, I hoped so badly that everyone was wrong. Surely the franchise that shaped my childhood hadn\'t completely imploded. Right?Wrong.The moment the movie opened with the thrilling white-knuckle speeder chase scene - which literally appeared to be taking place at about 40mph - I knew that my hopes of not regretting looking up to Han Solo as a child were in grave danger.The music was great. Maybe too great. It was the first time I\'ve ever had the music actually take me out of the experience. I often found myself thinking, ""These visuals aren\'t nearly interesting or important enough to justify this intense music."" Unfortunately, almost every action scene, and even the ""big moments"" like Han and Chewy sitting in the cockpit together for the first time, simply fell flat.There were plenty of explosions, but they forgot to pull us in with characters and a plot that we could care about. It felt like a factory assembly line movie, where the studio recycles a bunch of proven parts, and expects us to buy the product because we\'ve bought it so many times in the past. Unfortunately, they forgot to include a battery, and that little mistake left it completely lifeless.As Yoda might say, ""Big music and big budget a great movie do not make.""I literally watched Solo solo...because about 30 minutes into the movie, the only other person in the theater left. And I would have followed suit, but I just kept believing that it would get better. It had to get better. It\'s a movie about Han Solo.But it didn\'t. It was another politically correct, agenda-infused Disney dud that, quite honestly, riding on the coattails of ""The Last Jedi"", has officially left me feeling embarrassed that I ever liked Star Wars in the first place.And am I the only one who made it far enough into the movie to see Lando wailing in agony over the ""death"" of his droid? That was just embarrassing. I couldn\'t help but laugh, not only because it was hilarious, but also as a way of venting the sudden awareness that my childhood fascination with these characters from a galaxy far, far away had just died.I couldn\'t watch more than 5 minutes at a time without re-writing lines of dialogue in my mind. Were they even trying at the script phase of production, or did they just scramble to get a bunch of words on the pages so they could get to the fun part of creating digital creatures and backdrops?Who knows? All I know is that it\'s time to finally acknowledge that Star Wars is and will always be George Lucas\' brain child. And apparently the adoption process for brain children doesn\'t turn out well.', 'Solo was a bore. Uninteresting characters, terrible representations of Han and the Star Wars universe, dull everything. I just wish it was better, wouldn\'t that be great to finally have a good SW movie again?This movie is pure product with no imagination. It comes across as existing solely to make money for Disney; I mean way more than the average movie is made to make money. I feel like no one involved at any level in this production had passion for the project or cared about anything other than, ""This better make money"". Well, it didn\'t.', ""As expected, the film has been met with huge criticism, which in my opinion is wholly unjust and just another opportunity for so called 'star wars' fans to voice their disapproval for Disney. Solo is not the biggest and boldest SW feature by any stretch, but it is true to the original trilogy material without resorting to overly complicated plots, ropey CGI effects and forced comedy. It provides action , excitement, great dialogue, romance and a vast array of alien creatures (that were lacking in Rogue 1) and genuinely feels like a SW film, albeit with an interesting western inspired spin. Its Star Wars with everything we love about the saga. If you hate it.. perhaps its time you realised you might not be a SW fan after all."", 'Is it because the cinematography is drab? Was that because of Ron Howard or Lord and Miller? Did Disney over \'disneyfy\' the franchise?All those are questions up for debate. What isn\'t up for debate? The claim \'Star Wars Fatigue\' is damage control. Bad damage control.If you\'re curious what an over budget train wreck looks like: this is the film for you. Otherwise relegate it to the same shelf as ""The Hobbit: Trilogy"" and recognize it for what it is - someone just cashing in on a lucrative franchise at the financial expense of those who love everything else about the franchise.', '""Apollo 13"" director Ron Howard\'s ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" qualifies as an exercise in trivial pursuit rather than a sensational space odyssey in the thriving ""Star Wars"" franchise. Unfortunately, this frivolous, uninspired potboiler pales by comparison with the best: ""Rogue One."" Mind you, ""The Force Awakens"" featured captivating characters with far more impressive pyrotechnics than ""Solo."" Happily, the second ""Star Wars Story"" is neither as bombastic nor as pretentious as the execrable ""Last Jedi."" Unfortunately, ""Solo"" suffers from the problems afflicting prequels. Since we know none of the franchise leads--Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian--can die, the filmmakers generate only half as much suspense. The ill-fated characters that perish exert little impact in the greater context of events. Apart from prequel-itis, ""Empire Strikes Back"" scenarist Lawrence Kasdan and son Jonathan squander more time on penny-ante trivia about the eponymous character instead of fashioning a genuine, white-knuckled, escapade that might have propelled the franchise to greater heights. A mediocre B-movie, ""Solo"" is a routine crime thriller set among the stars. The best scene involves an elaborate but nerve-racking, roller-coaster train heist on a prodigious mountainside. Everything else seems superficial. At least one scene resembled the dudgeon scene in ""Return of the Jedi."" The aerial combat scenes with the Tie Fighters attacking the Falcon conjure up fewer thrills than the initial stand-off in the original ""Star Wars."" Han\'s adversaries project minimal menace. They fold like accordions in our hero\'s hands. Worse, they don\'t die spectacular deaths. You\'ll neither find a diabolical Darth Vader nor an arrogant Orson Krennic lurking in the background. A campy gargantuan octopus in outer space with teeth makes the depiction of the Kessel Run appear ludicrous rather than legendary. \n \nBasically, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" amounts to a laundry list of trivia serving as dots to connect the humdrum plot. Evidently, the people at Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Features, Imagine Entertainment, and Allison Shearmur Productions thought that depriving the title character of any shred of mystery would be indispensable for ""Star Wars"" aficionados. Why the Kasdans couldn\'t have made Han Solo into a livelier fellow still eludes me. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" never really gets under Han\'s skin, and the script seems intent on filling in the blanks of the Harrison Ford character as reincarnated by a different actor. Han Solo\'s younger version (Alden Ehrenreich of ""Heil, Caesar"") bears little resemblance to his lanky predecessor. Appropriately, he is an optimistic soul who hasn\'t attained the wisdom that years of hardship would later impart. Strutting about like Billy the Kid, Ehrenreich smiles too often to be taken seriously. Of course, everybody is bound to appreciate the irony when he utters the line: ""I\'ve got a good feeling about this."" If the film establishes anything, it is Han\'s naivety. He spends the entire movie fooling himself that he isn\'t the good guy, even when his passing love interest observes that he isn\'t a good guy. Arguably, the most controversial aspect that ""Star Wars"" purists will clamor about concerns Han\'s precipitant action in the final showdown with Beckett. For years, Lucas waffled about Han\'s clash with Greedo in the Mos Eisley Cantina. After altering it for the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ""Star Wars,"" he turned around and changed it again no less than twice. This minutia is the single thing that distinguishes this otherwise the somnolent saga.\n \nNevertheless, the filmmakers address a number of questions any ""Star Wars"" fan would love to know. Indeed, we learn how Han acquired not only his surname, but also won the Millennium Falcon while gambling with duplicitous Lando Calrissian during a game of Sabacc. Furthermore, we learn the circumstances of Han\'s chance encounter in a prison cell with Chewbacca. While most of the film sticks to the original details that have been part and parcel of the ""Star Wars"" film franchise as well as the Extended Universe of the ""Star Wars"" spin-off novels, Howard and the Kasdans have altered those circumstances for dramatic purposes. Originally, Han had been an Empire officer who had intervened on behalf of Chewbacca while a fellow Empire officer was torturing the Wookie. In ""Solo,"" the two are thrown together unceremoniously as prisoners in an oubliette, a prison that can only be accessed by a trapdoor in the ceiling. Nowhere in the film do the filmmakers account for Han\'s ability to converse with Chewbacca in the Wookie\'s own language. An important character, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers""), exists as a mentor who recruits Han into the big league of crime. Beckett furnishes Han with his distinctive firearm, a blaster pistol with a scope on it. A career criminal who refuses to trust anybody, Beckett wields probably the greatest influence over our protagonist. Earlier, we were told about the oppressive ""Oliver Twist"" like conditions that governed his formative years as a juvenile delinquent on the ship-building planet Corellia. Later, the details of the Kessel Run are fleshed out, but the schlocky space octopus sabotages any thrills. Remember, you cannot have suspense when you already know the outcome. \n \nApart from a tremendous train heist, ""Solo"" delivers little nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat, tension despite its lavish $250-million budget. When you consider how long ""Star Wars"" fans have awaited such an opportunity, it is hopelessly disheartening to have a film that winds up being such a superficial, sophomoric saga. The problems that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy encountered after she fired original co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of ""The Lego Movie,"" replacing them with Oscar winning helmer Ron Howard, who restaged three-quarters of the movie, undoubtedly must have exacted a dire toll on the film. Moreover, ""Solo"" amounts to the least picturesque entry in the franchise with some of the drabbest cinematography. Entire scenes have been photographed in sepia, so that faces, costumes, uniforms, and technology appear washed out against shimmering white backgrounds. Indisputably, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story,"" lacks the force that made the classic ""Star Wars"" adventures entertaining.', ""So so much potential utterly unexploited, thus delivering a vapid action film. It's a pity it had the Star Wars tag, or I might have given it 5 out of 10.\nWhere to start; bland action sequences, minimal character development, PC virtue signalling and dodgy timeline link in (bad guy from an earlier different film, no spoilers). It had them all. The film had me looking at my watch quite quickly. \nRogue One showed Star Wars spin offs can work, and add depth to existing characters, but this is how not to do it. I hope this will be a solo film but they were desperately lining up a sequel..."", 'Overall the acting for the main characters is exceptional. However once a character more annoying, stupid, and pointless than Jar Jar comes in I lost all respect for the film. Disney stop throwing in your political opinions and make a decent movie. You guys are getting pretty good at ruining franchises. Maybe its time to say goodbye to Star Wars.', ""Bad movie, Don't waste your money. Climax is underwhelming, and the scenes with L3-37 are jarring, they don't fit the plot, and make the film unwatchable. If all the L3-37 scenes were removed, it might be an ok movie."", 'Man I was pumped to see this movie, took my posse and everything. Well, I almost fell asleep! Boring, uninteresting, not funny - the list goes on. Waaaay too long, and failed to capture/hold our interests. We booked it as soon as the credits rolled because we were all really over it (not just my clan, EVERYONE in the theater scramed). In fact, I considered asking for my money back. Do yourself a favor and wait for the movie to come out for home viewing (or maybe just skip it altogether - it adds nothing to the saga). 2 stars for Donald Glover', ""So this is my first or second review I ever wrote on here. I love SF, always have, especially Star Wars movies. This is quite literally the worst movie I watched in the last couple of years. They just keep dragging star wars franchise lower and lower. They forced so much stuff, acting is really bad, zero plot twists what so ever. Ending of the movie is like ?!?! why just why, doesn't make any sense. The only charcter I liked was Chewbacca."", ""Hollywood really ruined the Starwars Brand, and Shame on Disney for allowing it to happen. I will Never go to another Star Wars film in the theatres after this Flop! Star Wars is supposed to be about fantasy, about escaping from reality, about taking a two-hour vacation away from our world. Kathleen Kennedy's decision to ham-handedly inject moments of wokeness into a beloved universe, a universe that is supposed to be set a long time ago in a faraway galaxy, mind you, is killing a franchise even the dreaded Lucas prequels could not kill."", 'To be quite honest, there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. I have a cat named Leia. I am in the process of getting a Star Wars tattoo. I\'ve loved Star Wars since I was born. This movie has, withholding all exaggerations for attention, almost (italics, /almost/) ruined the Star Wars franchise. The clear and unapologetic pandering and fan service (that I am usually okay with, when done well) shows that the new Disney Star Wars wants only one thing: your money. This movie is so bad, it won\'t even get that.\nI think the potential behind this movie could have made it something incredibly unique. When the film starts, you see the young Han speeding away from a group of officers chasing after him. He doesn\'t look back. The vibe felt almost Cowboy Bebop to me. In the theater, I got excited. ""So that\'s the vibe we\'re going for!"" Think about it, that sounds awesome. Solo is a space cowboy. And even if the film didn\'t follow such a formula to the exact degree, the vibe, color, emotion, and nostalgic aura of the very opening scene created something that made me think ""maybe this won\'t be so bad"".\nBut, I was wrong. What followed was a sloppy, dimly lit bore of an adventure that had me asking more questions (questions such as ""why do I care about this character, again?"" or ""what are the stakes? If there are any?"") than getting as excited as I was at the very beginning.\nI understand necessary scenes, I understand adding certain characters (I actually quite liked Han and Chewie\'s meeting... until Ehrenreich started to speak Wookie with an impression worse than my older brother\'s). Personally, I do not think anyone is upset about the necessary fan service. What people are upset about is the handling of this fan service. When given characters so dearly loved, so understood, it almost seems like it\'s impossible to fail. The blueprints, the bones, the heart is there.\nAnd yet I found no heart whatsoever. Every performance, even from actors I respect (Harrelson, Glover, Bettany) were terribly flat, but I don\'t blame them for that. It was just like watching actors like Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, even Hayden Christensen (who had honest performances in movies outside of Star Wars) in the prequels. The talent behind movie (even THE Lawrence Kasdan has writing credits for this film, if you can believe it) is wasted because of the hands of the studio not knowing what to do with Star Wars anymore. Following in Rogue One\'s footsteps, Solo was destined for changes that would ruin any source of novelty the moment it was thought up in the Disney drawing room.\nI went into Solo: A Star Wars Story with low expectations. I left disappointed still. Star Wars holds a particularly special place in my heart, but with every major decision being made in the recent franchise (save The Force Awakens), the flame is slowly dying out.\nThere\'s no excuse for this movie\'s existence. Skip it, if you want to keep any hope for Star Wars alive.', 'But all the reviews that start out saying they didn\'t like whatever recent Star Wars movie but people who don\'t like Solo are ""haters"" are indeed Disney bots making sure the aggregate stays over 7. Remember That. This movie is totally the Gredo shot first version of solo. The lead actor is absolutely atrocious, and Donald Glover is extremely disappointing and over safe. . Anyone looking for a real Han Solo story that doesn\'t cater to the lowest common denominator in bt cgi nonsense that, if taken out of the movie would have the run time come in at about the 34 mins of actual Plot; should read (yes read, imagine that) the Han Solo Trilogy. Written by AC crispin, in the late 90s early 00s, it\'s extended Star Wars universe at its finest before Disney decided to wring every cent out of it. Han shot first type stuff. Stop supporting Disney when they make these awful movies and they\'ll stop making them.', 'The best part of this film is when the end credits come on!', ""Should have been titled\nSolo: A Nope Wars StoryAll you need to know about this film is first... the actor they hired to play Han Solo, did NOT fit the role with his bland acting. He didn't carry himself like Solo, he didn't talk like Solo and he didn't act like Solo. Second... The woman responsible for this title is getting fired.I enjoyed the prequels, and the original films. If you love Han Solo as a character, do NOT see this abomination."", 'Disney! ... Eat it yourself!With regard to the new ""han Solo"", one thing can be said: #IMPUDENCE attempt to get a few more hundreds of millions of dollars from such a successful and cult franchise as the ""Star Wars"" fail.', 'SPOILERS: I\'ll watch any sci fi but this plot jumped the shark\nIn fact, it jumped the great white shark from Jaws!Giant octopi don\'t live in hyper space vacuum, then get sucked into red black holesThe action was ok before the incredible flying sequences, including the aforementioned space octopus Ships going that fast can\'t just dodge millions of huge obstacles that seem to converge 4 inches after the ship passes And how does a future ground cannon miss a huge ship 100 yards away?Tone it down please, this is not suppposed to be a ""space balls""', 'People are awakening. The suckers are no longer. The audience is beginning to understand that all the stupid sequels and prequels and remakes are just that: STUPID.\nSorry, Di$$$$ney and other studios: originality is in. Your greedy sickness is out.', 'I just didn\'t like this movie and created an account just to write it somewhere. Apparently you have to be a real critic to write a review on Rotten Tomatoes. Anyways, someone on Rotten Tomatoes put it well in saying that Solo took all of the imagination out of the Star Wars story. To me it felt like it filled in too many blanks. Why couldn\'t Han\'s last name simply be Solo? It didn\'t need to be an English nickname. It killed the idea that he could be otherworldly. Oh, and let\'s go ahead and point out that we\'ll call Chewbacca ""Chewie"" from now on.\nI went into this wondering if they would mention the Kessell Run not knowing that would be the whole plot to the entire movie. It\'s like they didn\'t try to be creative and it killed my imagination. Let\'s just explain it all. The Lando guy did a good Lando impersonation- I still don\'t like the character. Let\'s really talk about these capes because that\'s different, right? Ugh. I imagine that\'s to sell figurines and Halloween costumes. Thanks Disney. They wrote for Han to give a wookie impression? To me it felt like breaking the 4th wall rather than adding context. Just have Han speak English to him and they understand each other. I wish they had left my imagination to think the way they understand one another had a mystique. Like clairvoyant we-just-understand-each-other thing. The writers just seemed compelled to explain every single thing.For what it\'s worth, Woody Harrelson did a good job playing Woody Harrelson.I just thought they could\'ve slowed the story down and taken things in a different direction. It felt more like a comic book origin story than something special. This goes on the list of movies to watch when you\'re sick. You know, when you\'re sprawled on the couch and you can turn over only to listen while you\'re half asleep. And they could\'ve picked someone to play Han that was as tall as Harrison Ford and had him complain more. He was all smiles and looked more like the double for Lone Star in Spaceballs if I was suffering from face blindness.', ""If they take out any references and names from Star Wars and make this a standalone movie in its own universe, it can be a movie to watch before falling asleep.But as a Star Wars movie it's a joke, just like the rest that Disney spewed out since Episode 7 with no exception. It's a disservice to Star Wars fan and its sole purpose is to sell toys.""]",/posters/xSolo:.jpg
