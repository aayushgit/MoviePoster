Nelson,', 'Holly Hunter,', 'Sarah Vowell']","[""This movie is fantastic, loved the story and the characters. Where this movie loses points is in three separate continuous sequences of intense flashing. My sister is epileptic, and with no warnings we weren't prepared for any of it. She ended up seizing after the first sequence, and we had to cover her eyes for the their two. If you or any family members are sensitive to this sort of thing, AVOID THIS MOVIE."", ""Great Movie! This movie seems to really improve on the original, with the same memorable characters such as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Edna, with new break-out characters, notably Jack-Jack. Micheal Giacchino nailed the score, and like other Pixar/Disney films there are amazing visuals. However, the thrill and brain of this movie, differentiates itself from the traditional cookie-cutter PG animated films. So far, it has been highly rated by critics, and could be one of the biggest releases of 2018. I can't wait for Incredibles 3."", 'Funny and fast paced: granted. Should that be enough? My two main concerns;1) Everything feel forced: by example, the character of Edna is brought back with no real justification (the choice to babysit Jack-Jack, really?). You may cut her scenes and the plot remains the same. She is not here because the story needs her; this is the usual ""making by the numbers"" that defines Disney these days.2) The motivation of the villain is extremely weak. (Spoiler ahead) She is upset because her father believed in superheroes and he lost his life during a home invasion. Sorry, but it sounds that she must consume her energies for revenge against petty criminals, instead of superheroes (Imagine somebody close is killed during an assault but police arrive late... Will you decide to convert into a vigilante against police officers or against criminals?). Once again, this feel extremely forced.I know that the majority of moviegoers just want the thrills and easy laughs (thanks, Jack-Jack) and put character motivations and plot in second plane. If that is your case, you will have a great time indeed.', ""I've waited patiently for 14 years for the sequel to my all-time favorite animated film and I'm excited to say, it was well worth the wait; I just hope I don't have to wait another 14 years for a follow up. It did a great job of balancing comedy, drama, the action scenes were spectacular and I LOVED the new supers they added to the franchise; Sophia Bush's Voyd was my favorite out of the new characters, she was dope. Everyone had a moment to shine but Jack Jack was, hands down, the MVP of this movie. I'm going to see this film at least 2 more times in the theater. Bravo, Brad Bird; you did it again!!!"", 'If you have epileptic spouses or family members do not see this in theaters. The intensity of a big screen , lights , and sounds has hundreds complaining. People with eplipesy will be highly sensitive to this movie . My girlfriend simpl could not handle the third act of the movie. As many reviews have alos stated this. A fair warning from disney, or local theaters would prove useful. For the audience and the individual. The plot was average. Predictable. The cheeky keen ""good guys"" turn out to be sinister all along. Uses of characters could have been executed better. Especially edna. She specializes in desgining super suits for serious matters yet she is a babysitter. Excellent animation and great editing for five stars.', ""Let me start by saying that the Incredibles (2007) was one of my all time favorite animations, which is why i was so confused about a sequel 14 years after the first one. But given the fact that i really liked the first one, there was no way in which i wouldn't go and watch this one.I wasn't expecting much to be totally honest, because i have come to realize that sequels many years in the making often doesn't make a good watch, and i was right, i didn't see anything worthwhile. It's not to say the movie was bad, it was entertaining for the most parts, but it was an unnessecary sequel that had many flaws and weren't worth the wait....that is....if someone was actually waiting for it.The opening scene of the movie was very over the top, it threw me off completely, as it was loud and exhausting to watch...but after that, the pace slew down a bit and i was able to enjoy most of it.The plot weren't that special too, i was able to see the outcome from a mile away.....surprise surprise, the overly good people are the actual villains.\nOne thing that struck me the most is that the movie lacked the charm it had in the first one, although the characters looked amazing, the special effects are better and the voice acting is really good, it just didn't feel as charming and as endearing as the first one, maybe it wasn't the movie's fault really, i think that's a natural outcome if you're going to make a sequel 14 years later is that people's mind have developed in such a way that what you did to leave a good impression on them 14 years ago wouldn't work now....specially with all those really good movies coming out in all those years....my point is that, if you're going to make a sequel that many years later, you have to bring something new to the table and not just special effects and loud scenes.Overall, the movie was entertaining in the most parts and i would suggest that you go out and see it if you liked the first one, but don't expect it to better than the original and don't believe the hype. it's just an entertaining movie, you shouldn't expect more than that because nothing is worth 14 years of waiting."", ""I have been a Disney/Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, Throughout the years they have made wonderful films but however have made decent films. The Incredibles for me falls under the decent category, I don't understand what was the big hype about this one and still don't to this day. Now look it's not bad but it wasn't my cup of tea. This sequel doesn't quite live up to the expectations of it's first film and honestly compared to the one 14 years ago they used the same formula that didn't quite mesh well this time around. Weak story, Villain very predictable and the action might be too intense for some viewers.I don't hate this film but again it just wasn't for me and I may not understand why everyone likes it so much...So take this review with a grain of salt"", 'SPOILER: I have occasionally been asked, ""What is your favourite movie?"" It is a question I find hard to answer but ""The Incredibles"" usually comes to mind.The first movie was brilliant on so many levels and all the characters had depth, even the minor ones like Mirage and Bob\'s boss. The tension between Bob and Helen felt real but was constrained in a way that was totally appropriate for a family movie. The humour was clever and tensions worked out in a thoroughly plausible way. The movie thoughtfully and often subtly explored family dynamics in a manner unprecedented in superhero movies or mainstream animated movies,In the first movie Bob and Helen were both strong, willful characters who learned from each other. They put effort into their marriage and were ultimately rewarded for it but it was portrayed realistically as a work in progressIn this movie, not.It was not brilliant on any level other that the technical. The animation was fantastic. Although I actually enjoyed the parts of the movie there was much I did not like.The characters lacked the depth of the first movie. Helen as others have pointed out was particularly shallow, ironic considering how aggressively feminist the plot was.The minor characters were like cardboard cutouts. The new superhero crew seemed to try to tick demographic boxes, although I am sure someone will rant there was none identifying as a woman of colour with a speaking part. (apart from Frozone\'s wife Honey)The tension between Bob and Helen was largely replaced by Bob\'s tension with the feminist world view. Bob\'s emasculation for most of the movie was nauseating to watch. While feminists may rejoice at the role reversal, I have met very few women who find underachieving, stay at home dads attractive.The villain was quite predictable and her story-line felt contrived.An over arching feminist agenda seemed to dominate the movie in a thoroughly skewed manner.Pro women:\n1. the main superhero action was given to Helen. She is portrayed as nearly perfect and able to singlehandedly do almost anything.\n2. the main superhero of the new group is Void\n3. the main politician is the Ambassador\n4. Violet gets a story arc but Dash gets very little. (Jack Jack does but babies are rather gender-less). Violet\'s superpowers save people several times\n5. the technical wizards of the movie are both women and although Edna Mode is arguably transgender, she still identifies as a woman.\n6. the evil genius is a woman but not that evil; almost as if to say women villains are so much nicer than male ones. She only tried to kill one person, where as Syndrome actually killed several. For a bonus feminist point she is quite possibly lesbian and therefore really does not need men at all.\n7. Violet after much effort, angst and embarrassment finally gets her date with a nice guy, only to leave him standing at the ticket counter. The message is loud and clear, girls can do as they want, when they want and men should accept this without question. Anti men\n1. Bob is portrayed as inept, reckless when doing the superhero thing and chauvinistic. Even when doing his superhero stuff, he never succeeds until one or more people are helping.\n2. Dash has a relatively minor role and is often reckless and impulsive just like his dad. His most memorable achievement is stealing a car!\n3. Rick Dicker a important male authority figure from the first movie, is portrayed as ineffectual and is put out to pasture.\n4. Winston Deavor is arguably dangerously naive, implausibly altruistic and rather shallow.Finally the most ridiculous part of the whole movie. Jack Jack. It is a given that a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy any superhero movie but usually there are rules to constrain the plot and make the story worth while and set up an internal coherence. Every Superman has his kryptonite and in another age every Achilles had his heel. In what universe is a baby with highly destructive, poorly controlled and nearly limitless superpowers a good idea? That Jack Jacks antics have such benign effects is implausible to say the least. However did the raccoon survive? By sheer political correctness I suspect. We can\'t have babies killing wild animals in a Disney movie. The internal realism of the first movie is thoroughly absent here.In summary it feels as if the original movie got a Neo-Marxist rewrite. There was enough spark left over from the original movie to make it watchable but not enough to redeem it.', 'Saw it last night with my wife and two kids(3 and 5). Kids really laughed only at Jack Jack. Certainly not the level of amazement and immersion we experienced watching the the first Incredibles. I saw the first one back in the day and then just last week on video with my kids, just to prepare for Incredibles 2. Sorry to say i was extremely disappointed.Pros:\n1. Animation and action scenes were amazing\n2. The few times the family worked together to fight the bad guys.\n3. Jack-JackCons(some, not all):\n1. Before the movie started, why did they show the voice actors introducing the movie and ""telling"" us we\'ll love it? they are all old. That kinda messed me up since the movie continued in the parking lot after Dash\'s track meet where they were still young(2004). So my image of the parents and kids would still be those of where the first film left off. I love Holly Hunter, but their faces messed me up for like the first 30 min. but then i forgot about the intro.2. The villain(unknown to Helen) and Helen drinking alcohol when they got together. Just seemed strange for a kids movie and was like they were trying to tell us that women need to relax and drink too.3. Sequences with the kids: Bob being completely defeated caring for the kids. the kids disrespecting him all the time. I understand that is normal adolescent behavior, but why do they portray him as a total weakling.4. Forced diversity: the fricken green haired hero, i also saw a pink haired one, what was that big Brick ""they"" hero? The possessed bad guy heroes looked skinny and wimpy. And the old guy with vomit acid reflex powers? It wasn\'t funny.5. Probably shouldn\'t be a con by a guys standard, but Helen\'s curvy figure was distracting. it was like she was drawn to be super hot(with bigger boobs in some scenes) but still be a powerful mother..or something. Although hot, it didn\'t help the story.6. Weak villain. It wouldn\'t be a waste to see it at the movie theatre. just don\'t expect that you\'ll leave the theatre fulfilled like you did with the first movie.', ""Wow, just do yourself a favor a skip this one. I was a true fan of the original and was so excited to see more of this franchise -- but I actually fell asleep during this boring sequel! My problem had NOTHING at all to do with the movie having a female lead, but just that it was simply so uninteresting! Too much dialogue and build-up that never went anywhere, the characters were whiny, and I don't even think kids over 4 would enjoy this snooze-fest (if even then). What a waste of the past 14 years -- all that time passed and no one bothered to develop a clever or entertaining plot/script. My kiddo and I booked it immediately as the credits began to roll. What a blown opportunity. Notice how all the glowing reviews never mention specifics? They're all fake/paid for. Save your time and money on this one, trust me!"", 'I had to look and see who this movie was made by and was a little shocked that it was Disney. For one, they had two blatant cuss words, damn and hell, and the villain was a little Hannibal like. I feel like this is what is wrong with the world and what the world\'s norm is becoming. Why do you have to have ""I\'ll be damned"" in the movie, can you not think of another saying? It\'s as if now it is ok for children to use these ""light"" cuss words. And, yes I did see that someone also posted a seizure warning which I can totally see because there is a LOT of flashing. The movie was too long and the only thing I can say good is that it was action so it did keep my attention most of the time.', 'After 14 years of great Pixar movies and new worlds/stories, Incredibles 2 offers little to nothing. I was extremely excited for a sequel to one of my favorite Pixar movies, to my demise, this movie was nothing new.\nWhy Pixar did not write a new story, I wish I knew. This movie is simply a role reversal with forced comical attempts from jack jack, who is arguably the best part of the movie. It is sad that after 14 years we get a re-written movie in the wake of what could have been another smash hit from Pixar. Hopefully Toy Story 4 is not this much of a disappointment.', ""Did you guys seriously watch the same movie as me? Or did the screenslaver suck you in too? It's a lame-jane cash-grab. If this movie would be wiped from existence, everything would still be the same. An unbearably cluttered sequel. Mommy goes out to stop the bad guys to resurge the superheroes while daddy stays home to watch the kids. Thats it. I've seen better B-romantic comedy's with a more endearing plot outline. Its not a bad idea, but its execution was horrific. If it weren't propelled by the grandeur of the 2004 classic, Incredibles 2 would have much less appeal standing on its own.Incredibles 2.. where it begins with the perspective of an insignificant character and ends on a shipwreck. Wait, what was achieved in this story? Its a pish-posh sequel or a sit-com running overtime episodes for ratings. The writing/script was terrible. The pacing was forced. It felt very fake. Most importantly (why I'm dropping my rating from a 5 or a 6 out of 10) it never lets you feel a moment, which for a Pixar movie is a shock. Walked away thinking to myself that Incredibles 2 is the only Pixar film to ever do that. This was a poorly executed, poorly edited and excruciating blunder to sit through. It gave me anxiety. Everyone in my theatre was having a great time. I don't understand audiences anymore because if this quality of movie is what is appreciated, golly jee. If somebody could please tell me what was good about it other than the delightful baby and Violet's adolescence, ring my beeper. Nothing sentimentally shifts in the arch from where it starts to where it finishes. The character's I once loved and their crass representation in this instalment felt like watching a 2-hour cringe vine. You can't play tricks and bash me around and expect a satisfied reaction. It was like sitting in a noisy restaurant and you can't even have a conversation with the person you're eating with. The villain is weak and much of the character focus is muddled. On a filmmaking and entertainment level its annoying, fragmented, tainting, careless, unrelenting and very, very, very pointless. What was the vision?Not being negative, just being real. My eyes are wide open and I'm not being controlled by some executive..Am I not the only one who felt this way?"", 'Am I the only one who noticed that it was almost the exact same story as the first movie and it takes place immediately after.Rich investor from no where offers to bring back the pride or ""glory"" of the supers past days if only they will co-operate. Then this rich investor turns out to be the villain. They fall for it again almost immediately. The parallels continue on and on.How long are we going to let writers get away with just re-hashing the same story change a few bullet points, package it, and sell it to us as new. As with most here the only things I enjoyed were Jak-jak and new CGI. other than that I could use my money back.', ""14 years and doesn't even come close to the original. Lacks depth, originality, and a decent script. Almost feels like a spin-off feel good movie. By no means is it bad, but the tone change as well as a weak story whilst living in the shadow of the first just leads to a huge disappointment."", ""The reviews on here must be paid for. Saw with a group of 4 adults (3 were women) and 5 kids. Only 1 of the adult women laughed out loud during the movie and she only laughs at really simple humor. None of the other adults laughed and none of the kids did either.\nThe original was great (8/10 or 9/10), this was not. Even asking the kids all said they knew who the surprise 'villain' was early in the movie.\nMany animated movies have a depth to the movie that both adults and kids enjoy. This did not. It was very simple humor. The main humor had to do with the super powers of the baby and how hard it is to be the Dad left alone with the baby. Just wasn't funny unless you really like simple humor.\nI did hear a 5 year old girl tell her mom she really liked it on the way out. I think that was the target market."", ""Ok, i went to see this for my step sons birthday, needless to say we all left the movie disappointed, super predictible storyline, really dumb story. You basically know who the bad guy is right after they are introduced. The storyline seems like something from a scooby doo episode except not as good. This movie should have been a straight to video releases. I don't know why everyone is giving this movie such rave review. Maybe they just enjoy watching a baby shoot laser beams from their eyes and that satisfies them. As always, you have to compare this to the few 'perfect' movies out there. Compared to The Transformers animated movie, I'd have to give this movie one star. Also they had way too many shots of elasti-girls butt, which just looks awkward and gross. Don't waste your money folks."", 'The family is back fighting crime & saving the world this time in a not so comedic way, more so along the lines of ""leave it to beaver"" & ""father knows best."" The beginning starts off great, trying to save a city from total destruction - the whole family is involved here; when the smoke clears they relocate to a motel, their egos damaged but fate steps in and they again are moved to a swanky mansion with the works. Pops is stuck at home being the mother to the three rugrats especially the baby, Jack - Jack who as we see as the film drags on has these incredible (oh, you see what I did here?!) powers i.e. breathing fire & spewing out laser beams from his eyes (best scene involves Jack Jack and a pissed off racoon) - whilst elastic mom tries to save the city from a villain who leaves his victims in a trance; the film bounces back and forth to the father teaching his kids life lessons then wham! back to the scene of the crime that being \'elastic mom\' trying to save a monorail from flying off the tracks. This is a super hero version of ""Mr. Mom."" hmmm - two hours and change, really pixar?', ""The movie had great animation and honestly it was pretty cute at moments, but truthfully I'm so sick of all the political messages.

Jurassic World: Fallen KingdomÂ (2018) ,(2018),6.7,2h 8min,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']",PG-13,"When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.",J.A. Bayona,Derek Connolly,"['Chris Pratt,', 'Bryce Dallas Howard,', 'Rafe Spall']","['1) It\'s bad. I didn\'t like Jurassic World, but this is worse. It\'s got broad characters, lackluster set-pieces, a noisy score and the kind of script which should be punishable by throwing its writers to sharks. At least Jurassic World, mediocre as it was, had the good sense to copy the first Jurassic Park. Fallen Kingdom foolishly imitates The Lost World instead, with a semi-watchable first half on the island and an abysmal last act with dinosaurs wreaking havoc back to civilization.Kudos to the late John Hammond for building his park on a volcanic island. Also, I hate to ask but, since it\'s a plot point that dinosaurs will face extinction (again!) if they are not rescued from Isla Nublar\'s volcano... what happened to Isla Sorna (Jurassic Park 2 and 3)? There were dinosaurs on it as well. I\'m sure some novelization or website makes up a lame excuse, but the movie doesn\'t. 2) Stop overcomplicating blockbusters. Jurassic Park featured an intelligent, complex sci-fi premise, but the actual plot had an elegant simplicity to it. Fallen Kingdom tosses in betrayals, cloned little girls and evil corporations selling dinosaurs to warlords.3) Speaking of that, enough with the ""dinosaurs as military weapons"" nonsense! This is a concept which appealed to all of us when we were kids (""I want to ride a T-Rex! And it should have a rocket launcher on it!"")... but you cannot have War Dinosaurs in anything that wants to be taken seriously by adults. You know why Navy SEALs don\'t have units of trained lions? Why no army has rhinos bred to be ridden into battle? Because nobody in modern warfare would spend money (let alone MILLIONS as in this movie) for a huge beast which would be an economical and logistical nightmare to raise, train, feed and manage, especially when a random enemy soldier could blow it to smithereens with a 100 $ grenade. Someone should tell writer Colin Trevorrow that war elephants aren\'t a thing anymore, while firearms and explosives are.(Note that the dinosaur boogeyman of this movie, the Indoraptor, is so ineffectual that it repeatedly fails to kill its unarmed targets in the endless climax. Some infallible weapon: there is a scene where three characters are pinned under a tree and the Indoraptor manages to... scratch one of them in the knee before they escape. You know what could have killed them more efficiently than your 30-million-dollars War Dinosaur? One guy with a pistol!)4) Fallen Kingdom assumes you are really, really interested in Blue, the Chris Pratt-trained Raptor from Jurassic World. The script retcons Blue into a sympathetic, heroic creature which displayed diligence and empathy since it was young; funny, I recall it killing several innocents in the previous movie (and attacking Pratt himself with no provocation in their first scene), but whatever. 5) Since we mentioned Chris Pratt: much like Jurassic World, this movie doesn\'t know how to use him. Pratt is ideally cast not as a badass, but as someone who *thinks* is a badass - a character who is capable but somewhat out of his league. He works so much better as a slightly comedic, self-deprecating protagonist (Guardians of the Galaxy) than as a tediously infallible, dead-eyed action figure. His Owen never changes. There is more character development implied with a small prop in Jurassic Park (the Raptor claw Grant uses to scare a kid at the beginning, which he throws away after bonding with Lex and Tim) than in all Owen\'s scenes in Fallen Kingdom.6) Howard is inoffensive but unremarkable as Claire: she is just kind of there, blandly good-looking, doing no damage but adding little value, like some sort of redhead lettuce. Her two sidekicks (Scared Nerd and Tough Latina) are insufferable though.(By the way, how is Claire not rotting in jail as the aftermath of Jurassic World? She is directly responsible for the dozens of casualties there, poorly handling the Indominus\' escape and refusing to evacuate the island. She must have one hell of a lawyer.)7) Poor Rafe Spall, a competent actor (see The Ritual, a much better monster movie), plays Greedy Corporate Guy, an antagonist so flat and obvious that I was disappointed he didn\'t get an Evil Laugh Scene... you know, he throws his head back and bellows ""Bwahaha!"" while the camera cranes up.I love how Rafe Spall builds a containment facility for dinosaurs under James Cromwell\'s mansion. Cromwell plays Old Sick Naive Rich Guy. Sorry, I don\'t care how old, sick and naive you are: you have no excuses if you don\'t realize someone is HIDING DINOSAURS IN YOUR BASEMENT. Really, Trevorrow? Is this some kind of spoof? 8) CGI is fine but overused. It\'s a visually busy movie. I\'ll give them credit for making the Indoraptor more visually distinctive than the boring-looking Indominus. At least they sort of splashed some yellow on it.9) I didn\'t care for most of the set-pieces. Remember how Spielberg took his sweet time with the T-Rex breakout or the Raptors in the kichen? Here most action beats are over right after they begin (the Baryonyx, the Carnotaurus...). There is no build-up, no crescendo. It\'s the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation. I did mildly enjoy the prologue with the T-Rex and the Mosasaurus, although... why would the park build a giant door which allows the Mosasaurus to swim away into the ocean? What kind of scenario were they envisioning in which the escape of the humongous sea monster would be a positive outcome? I mean, come on. I\'m not usually a nitpicker, but this movie seems to be actively trolling anyone giving it a minimum amount of thought.10) The stupid ending sets up another sequel. I guess we\'ll finally get the inevitable War Dinosaurs. *sigh*4,5/10 To people asking ""What were you expecting in a film about dinosaurs?"", I answer: ""Something maybe not on par, but at least in the same league as Jurassic Park, one of my favorite movies of all time"".Still, if all you want is an action/adventure with many different dinos, regardless of lousy storytelling and flat characters, have fun with this one.', ""When it comes to gigantic blockbuster franchises, the law of diminishing returns typically applies. Each new film somehow manages to be bigger and dumber, while also offering audiences pretty much the same experience that raked in the box-office bucks in the first place. That's why Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom comes as a pleasant surprise. It's far from perfect, with a screenplay that veers between breathtaking and breathtakingly silly. But there's a lot of thought and quite a bit of bravery invested in everything on display: from story, character and thematic development, to where this dino-driven series can go in the future.On the surface, the plot is simple enough: Isla Numbar, the theme-park island left abandoned in Jurassic World, is facing an existential crisis. A volcano is about to erupt, threatening to take with it the dinosaurs now roaming freely all over the island. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), now a dinosaur rights activist, convinces former dino trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to return to Isla Numbar and save what dinosaurs they can, including (but especially) fan-favourite velociraptor Blue. Before long, they find themselves entangled not in a rescue operation, but in an utterly grim, cynical criminal enterprise.It doesn't sound particularly groundbreaking, but what works refreshingly well is how Fallen Kingdom approaches the serious moral questions raised by the very premise of the entire Jurassic Park franchise. What happens when human beings play God, and bring dinosaurs back to life? How far can we push this power to manipulate genetic destiny? And do human beings have an ethical duty to preserve and protect a species that, by all the laws of nature, shouldn't even exist?Fallen Kingdom doesn't just flirt with these questions, as its predecessors did. It places them squarely in the foreground, however uncomfortable this may become for the film's characters or audiences. Throughout its far stronger first half, the film continually asks us to ponder issues of complicity and responsibility in a complex world. It pushes the original idea behind Jurassic Park - a new-found ability to literally resurrect the past - to its logical conclusion, and asks again and again what happens when the things humans create take on lives of their own.The film also benefits from director J.A. Bayona's remarkable ability to balance the epic and the intimate, as showcased so expertly in his tsunami drama, The Impossible. At its best, Fallen Kingdom serves up grand moments so startlingly effective in emotional terms that they might make you cry - whether it's Blue being, briefly, betrayed; or the sight of Isla Numbar retreating in the distance, the fiery backdrop for a sole dinosaur as it rages against the dying of the light. There's a truly eye-popping technical masterpiece of a scene that features humans and dinosaurs tumbling down a landscape ravaged by flame and fire. But the top-notch visual effects aren't the point. It's what the scene means, how it makes audiences feel - hearts lodging in throats at the prospect of innocent lives lost.As much as Bayona deserves credit for unearthing the heart and humanity in Fallen Kingdom, the screenplay by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly deserves some praise too. It contains some canny decisions that strengthen the franchise and its characters going forward. Claire, in particular, actually evolves - once the park's by-the-books operations manager, she is now a badass activist who dares to fight for what she believes is right. There's a great deal of potential, too, to the new character of Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the plucky young granddaughter of one of Jurassic Park's co-founders.It's a shame that the film slips into dumb and dumber territory in its second half. There are a couple of excellent moments, dripping with the tension and horror of Bayona's chilling directorial debut, The Orphanage. You can see what Bayona is going for: the appealing notion of turning dinosaurs into the proverbial monsters under the bed, a menace that could come for you in the safety of your own home. In this regard, the film's new hybrid dinosaur - the Indoraptor - takes centre stage, although it doesn't have quite the personality or appeal of either Blue or the iconic Tyrannosaurus Rex.But Fallen Kingdom shrinks into itself once the action is transposed from the island to the Lockwood mansion. The nuance and depth of the first half largely disappears. Instead, the film ends up trading in the kind of huge, intelligence-free action sequences that belong in a lesser sequel - from characters (and dinosaurs) plunging in and out of bedrooms and across a shatter-friendly glass roof, to mercenary Ken Wheatley's (Ted Levine) final encounter with the Indoraptor.The film also makes some narrative choices that seem silly even on paper, much less on screen. Daniella Pineda's spunky Zia Rodriguez is a fun addition as a paleoveterinarian - except she's never encountered a dinosaur in her entire life. (Why didn't they just make her a former Jurassic World employee, like Owen?) Similarly, the screenwriters demonstrate a bizarre disconnect from the real world when they put prices on the rescued dinosaurs - still insanely rare for being history made flesh - and come up with paltry amounts like $10 million each. (What criminal hijinks can you carry out for that amount of money?!) It makes the film's avaricious antagonists, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) and Gunnar Eversoll (Toby Jones), come across as pantomime villains instead of criminal masterminds.For the most part, however, Fallen Kingdom works. For a summer blockbuster, it's surprisingly thoughtful in examining the human - and dinosaur - condition. Its second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first, but it's still a fun enough romp. And the film ends as boldly as it begins. In completely re-calibrating the relationship between humans and dinosaurs in its final act, Fallen Kingdom doesn't just make a sequel welcome - it makes one necessary."", ""I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan but this movie is just not very good. It made no sense at all. Awful writing and acting with plot holes everywhere. In a world where top athletes are being transferred for over $100m, you'd think a dinosaur was a little more expensive than $10m?! But no, Mills' (Rafe Spall) eyes light up at the sight of selling a dinosaur for $10m. What's more, the total cost of all dinosaurs only totals at around $120m. That's less than the production of the movie! I'd love to see the overheads of the organisation for sending 100+ men in armoured vehicles with state of the art equipment to a dinosaur inhabited island in Costa Rica. They can't be looking at very high profit margins. Why not just sell the giant mansion with the secret underground lab and save all the hassle??

Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there.

There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever.

One scene in particular i expected the Dino to say; ""herrrre\'s Johnny.""\n In terms of story, the story may be a little complex, but far from confusing and with a surprising twist, it\'s a worthwhile sequel, unlike some more recent sequel attempts (""Deadpool 2...cough cough"").\n The acting is once again good, if not up to par with the original cast, but the most talented is the little girl, who has a bright future ahead if she decides to stay in this industry. \n All of that said, it means nothing if the Dinosaurs aren\'t up to par, but aside from the dubiously named Indoraptor, the Dino\'s are amazing and so textured, you can almost feel they are real animals at times. \n If i have any little gripes, i would say the movie lagged a little in the middle and after watching this in 3D, i would say they didn\'t use the 3D to it\'s best, so i\'d stick to 2D if i were you, because even then, this is a great film.\nIt is also a shame to not see some of the beautiful scenery of the other films.

However my one problem is the timing for the second act: which is the rescue mission on the island. Now don't get me wrong, the rescue operation sequence was great with the volcanic eruption, the Baryonx attack, Blue's return, the dino stampede. Everything was great. Sadly though it was rushed, the second act of the film only lasted for about 20-25 minutes in the movie (along with scenes taking place in the Lockwood Manor cutting in-between the island scenes) which made the second act not only rushed but a little disappointing yet amazing at the same time (it had ups and downs). My favourite part was: The Lockwood Manor. J.A Bayona once again did a great job in this part of the movie. The Indoraptor wreaking havoc at the manor was brilliant, the suspence it delivered was ground-breaking. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard stole the show as Owen and Claire in this sequence too, by being the badasses they are.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a brilliant movie!\n \nCongratulations to the cast and crew for making this movie!

Hands down the best horror films I've ever seen, perhaps one of the best films in general."", 'The acting in this movie was by far its redeeming trait. There was so much creepiness to go around and Toni Collette owned her role. I felt extremely uncomfortable at a couple points and almost regretted going to the theater alone.That all changed with the last 10 minutes. The movie is a little over two hours, so that\'s a long emotional investment. But then you get to the ""twist"" and it starts to get hokey and lame. The spookiness up until that point had now turned into what felt like a last ditch effort for an end to the movie. At one point in the movie, my mouth was hanging open in shock and horror, when the end credits started rolling, my mouth was hanging open in disappointment. If you want to love the movie, leave 15 minutes before it\'s over and just make up an ending in your mind. You\'ll feel much more satisfied.', 'This has been one of the most well shot, shocking and yet masterful horror movies in a very long time. Wow is just about all I can say. The music, the shots, the horror amazing. The acting was brilliant and heartfelt. You actually get a sense of genuine fear and paranoia felt from the characters. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking it looked cheesy but when I heard someone online say it was good I had to check it out.', ""This movie is not a traditional horror movie. In fact, I would even go so far as to say it is not even a horror movie at all, just a heavy drama movie with terrifying elements to it. This movie did absolutely everything right, from the extremely realistic dialogue, to the astoundingly realistic visuals, to the cinematography, and more. Everything about this movie just worked, there was absolutely no scene or shot that felt unneeded or unnecessary. The movie looked gorgeous, and then, fitting for the mood of the movie, it seemed to darken the colors and the tone of the shots and cinematography overall. The acting in this movie was complete perfection, down to even the most minor of characters. Toni Collette gives by far the best performance I have seen by an actress this year and I can easily say that she deserves to be acknowledged in the upcoming Oscars. Even Alex Wolff, whom I did not think would do a great job within the movie, did an outstanding job. The thing that drives this movie forward is the pure tension that is felt not only within the characters and between them, but with the audience as well. This movie is horror at its finest, pure tension, no reliance on jumpscares. There was a particular scene that just blew me away with how well it was shot, it involved a character being in their bed and then looking around their room thinking to have heard something, and all the while, there is a mysterious figure lurking in the darkness. And rather than use this figure to provide a chance for a cheap jumpscare, the director just lets the audience soak in the image of that entity in the room with the character, and no jumpscare happens. This is the definition of a pure horror movie that relies on tension and nothing else. This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen all year, and the second best horror movie I have ever seen, right behind 2015's The Witch. This movie blew me away, and if you are a fan of horror movies, drama movies, or both, go see this movie. It is utterly and completely amazing."", ""I've spent my whole life watching horror movies yet there were parts of this movie that left me in utter shock\nand horror, left me gasping and hoping they wouldn't go where they did.

I can't say enough good things."", 'This movie was utterly terrible, I went into the theater thinking I was going to see a good suspenseful horror film, I was wrong I sat there trying to get the main points of the plot.

I\'m so sick and tired of ""artsy"" crap movies. Don\'t tell me I ""didn\'t get it."" I got it and it was stupid.Don\'t waste your money.', ""When I was a kid, my parents often discussed a movie that they had seen when they first started dating: The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. People had been talking about how amazing the film was and when they went, they sat there confused and upset in the theater. For years, any time they rated a movie as boring, too strange or overly hyped, they would reference Argento's film. I always wondered if it upsets them that I grew up loving horror and giallo films so much.One day, I explained what I thought that movie was about to my parents. There's gender reversal, as well as being a foreigner and the isolation of modern life, filtered through the lens of an auteur. Maybe it didn't all make sense to him, but I think my explanation made them get a little more of why I liked it so much.My wife and I are planning on having kids some day. If one of them ever sits me down and explains why this movie is good to me, I'm going to disown them.If you thought movies like The Witch moved slowly, the glacial pace of this film makes that film seem like a slam-bang Honk Kong action pic. It takes forever to decide on what the movie is even about, smashing our expectations and killing off a major character - again, let me reinforce that spoiler warning - when Charlie goes to a party, has an allergic reaction and is beheaded while her brother races to get her to the hospital.That was the one true surprise of the film, one that made me think that it was getting ready to gear up and deliver on its promise to be the scariest movie of our generation.Look - I'm not going to deny the talent of the people involved in the film. Toni Collette is an amazing actress and she imbues the mother of this film with true emotion. It's as if her parts of this film seem to be a drama about dealing with loss and never truly understanding our parents and the gnarled roots of our family tree.While I was watching this film, a man snored loudly to my left and I wondered what magical dreams that he was having and how I could experience them instead of what was on the screen. I was jealous of the fact that his girlfriend allowed him the pleasures of dreamland while my wife continually poked me in the ribs to keep me awake during the slow opening of this film that then ground its gears to move even slower.Let's be perfectly frank. I hated this movie. It doesn't matter to me how many people love it or proclaim it as high art or say that it's the scariest movie they've seen and how much it haunts them. That's great - I'm happy that they had such a reaction to it. My reaction differs and I'm willing to sit down and ponder for nearly three times the length of this film exactly what I have to say about it. And that, I guess, is something of a success for this movie. Films should make you think and consider and examine. And this movie certainly did that. It also made me wonder exactly what I'd chose to watch when I got home to exorcise its stink from consciousness.This movie is style over substance, an effort that tries to tell a story that has no character to root for or care about. We have no idea what they are battling against so we have no way to figure out how they can avoid the outcome. I feel like I wasted money on this film, which is rough yet I can get it back, but I also wasted so much time caring about it and watching it, which is something that I can never get back. It needs an editor that could have trimmed its various narratives into a better collective whole. It's like steak on steak on steak, covered with 19 kinds of steak sauce, all eaten slowly through a straw after someone else has methodically chewed it for you. And after all that, it tastes like offal."", ""Boring regurgitation of every horror movie that came before it. I watched in stunned disbelief, hoping it would be saved by the third act. Instead, my wife and I were laughing out loud and the mounting stupidity. To have the talents of Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne, two actors incapable of giving a bad performance, and to have the result be this messy wannabe Twilight Zone episode is an utter catastrophe. Anyone who compares this mess to horror classics like The Exorcist and The Shining needs to have their critic cards revoked.I'd post spoilers, but there is nothing to spoil! Worst use of two hours in my 46 years of existence."", ""After such hype about this film and all the amazing reviews I was so excited to see a decent horror. This isn't horror, at all. The only plus point is so good acting as most of this film is a slow drawn out family drama, It has one of the WORST endings to a film, like completely pointless. I feel for a joke they put this film out as a project to see how many people would be tricked in to seeing it with enough media hype. You will never get this 2 hours back of your life, do literally anything instead and it will be time better spent."", 'I am a true lover of Suspense/Thriller/Horror genres. In a nutshell, the Pros: excellent acting from the main characters and a shocking event early in that was completely unexpected.

Don\'t waste your time or money. Don\'t read reviews from stupid people.

Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type.

No. It is a good movie?Sure. Are there plot holes/issues? Yes. What percentage of the film is CGI? 90%. Would I pay $20 to see it in theatres again? No. Would I buy it in an $5 Walmart Bin? Probably Not. Would I watch it again? Yes', 'Will any 14 year old Marvelfan will love this flick? OF COURSE!\nWill any real moviefan will hate this flick? OF COURSE!A rating round 9 at IMDB for this brainless effects-overkill is a hit in the face to movie histoty!', 'I don\'t mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War\'s 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it\'s 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it\'s awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn\'t let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn\'t particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It\'s fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn\'t really original and its only redeeming factor is that it\'s full of characters we all know and love. It\'s funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it\'s really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there\'s no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it\'s cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that\'s about it. The editing isn\'t particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it\'s too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it\'s 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.', 'Completely disappointing. A few mildly witty or funny scenes. The rest a sum of dumb and unwitty fights against an enemy who is already too strong at the beginning of the movie and only gets stronger during the film. The only suprises are negative ones, No resolution at the end of the film. Many dead. And now years to wait for a sequel...? My personal rating: Not worth the money.', 'Not everything that glitters is gold! I\'d say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that\'s included in the story. Look at what\'s happening with Star Wars.\nReturning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.\nThe last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.\nYes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.\n""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It\'s a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.\nI quote a friend: What\'s the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?', ""This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing. But if a crap movie like this is considerd to be as good as THE GODFATHER!!! then i can no longer trust this site and will de-recommend it to everyone that wants to use it for the same purpose as i did."", 'The movie is a great example of kitsch. A definition from web:\n""Kitsch is art that\'s garish, nostalgic, and very low-brow. Some people who love the aesthetics of souvenir culture think kitsch is really cool, while others think it\'s in very poor taste.Kitsch is a German word that\'s been adopted into English, meaning ""worthless, trashy art,"" or the quality of that art. A ceramic figurine of a puppy with sad eyes is pretty kitsch, as is a velvet Elvis painting. Of course some people think that kitsch is really beautiful and fill their homes with stuff that other people consider trashy souvenirs. If your painting teacher tells you your portraits are kitsch, that\'s probably not a compliment.""', 'The Avengers Infinity War was, to put it simply, a disappointment.SPOILERS BELOW!!!!This is saying a lot, because I have never been disappointed with a Marvel movie before. No matter how bizarre the plot, how many inconsistencies started to pile up across the various movies, it was OK, because they did one thing right: They remembered why we loved our Marvel heroes, and they kept them in character, no matter how often they didn\'t show up to each other\'s movies when they really probably should have. OK, that\'s not quite true (looking at you, Thor Ragnarok. But you were fun in all the right ways, so I didn\'t mind that you no longer spoke Shakespearean English, and messed up all the time-lines of how old things were set up by Thor 1 & 2). This is a long prelude, but I feel it\'s necessary to point out why Infinity War was such a total disappointment. Because on it\'s own, as a standalone film, it wasn\'t too bad. It was a pleasant change to see a villain with a backstory and real feelings, who genuinely believes he\'s doing what he needs to for the Greater Good of everyone. He wasn\'t very logical, and he also wasn\'t overly bright, but hey, at least he got to shed a tear (or two, or ten) in the (massive amounts) of screen-time the purple titan was allotted.And this was the problem. An IMDb user has given the screen-time breakdown for characters for this movie: I\'ll quote it here:\nimdb.com/list/ls066620113/\nThanos 29\'\nTony Stark / Iron Man 18\'\nSteve Rogers 6:45\'Yup. That\'s right. In a movie titled ""Avengers"", our Big Bad gets nearly twice the screen-time of our Avengers, who are reduced to bit-parts and have no character development at all.Worse, we\'re subjected to a farce, where Thanos can pulverize the Hulk and Thor (who has chosen to not use lightning for no apparent reason at all) in 3 seconds, but Captain America can hold his fist open for nearly ten seconds. Where Dr. Strange absolutely no, sorry but, cannot, ever, hand over that time-stone, but apparently sees no particular need to jump back in time and maybe reverse being on that ship in the first place? (Maybe even *gasps* turn back time until Starlord does not punch Thanos in the face? Or, why not trap Thanos in the sort of time-loop he used last time at the end of his movie? If I, a plebeian audience, can think of this, why can\'t Strange?). Where everyone tries to pull off Thanos\' glove, and no one thinks of putting his arm through one of those yellow-Strange-portal thingys and chopping said arm off, which we know worked perfectly well on Thanos\' kid. Where Loki, who can survive falling off the Bifrost and through space, apparently decides trying to stab Thanos with a dagger makes more sense than taking Thor and jumping out a window and letting the vacuum of space kill everyone on Thanos\' side who *can* be killed by that, since it\'s been a fact since he fell off the Bifrost that both he and Thor are immune to dying in space. Where Heimdall teleports Hulk back to earth, because apparently Hulk is more important than the King??? I will not even get started on poor Steve, Wanda, and Vision\'s arcs, or Starlord\'s. All I will say is that it IS trading lives if you trade 10,000 foot-soldier\'s lives for one Vision, and Starlord might be shallow but he DOES have a brain.But again, this is what happens when you decide that Thanos needs 29 minutes of screen time to angst about things like killing his kids and try justify why it\'s OK for him to kill half the universe, and Steve Rogers can make do with 6:45. Because this wasn\'t *about* the Avengers, or any of the characters I knew and loved and went to see this movie for. This was a story about Thanos, and the heroes I loved were used as plot-devices to further anything Thanos needed furthered in his story.Words cannot express my disappointment. The same movie, the same Thanos, with unknown heroes making these stupid choices (especially the oft-repeated, ""you can murder half the universe if it will stop someone I love from screaming/dying""), might have been enjoyable. Maybe. I don\'t know. If I didn\'t know or care about the characters being butchered to power Thanos\' character arc, I could have swallowed it.But I do know these heroes. I love these heroes. And that is why this movie was, to quote Thor, The Worst.1/10 for disappointment.\nShould have been called Thanos: My Life Story.', ""Nerfed superheroes both mentally and physically allow this plot line to continue a lot longer than it should.No sense of urgency. A casual walking pace, the inclusion of romantic interests in an attempt to give a bland movie some emotion feels extremely forced. Wooden acting.*spoilers not in any particular order*Heimdall transports Bruce to earth and not loki who had the tesseract or Thor.Gamora does not want Thanos to get a hold of her...runs directly to Thanos and engages him in battle knowing fully well she is nowhere near strong enough. There's about 3 of us here but let's go to Thanos and take the fight to him despite us knowing nothing of his home planet and what awaits them. Doctor Strange agrees to this blatantly, in Star lords words, bad plan which makes 0 sense. The stone curses red skull into becoming a wise dementor instead of killing himSoul stone is blood thirsty. Oh no there's only one outcome where we win and it involves the worst leader of all time Iron Man (-_-)Doctor Strange doesn't once use the time gem to battle Thanos. Thanos even says that but being self aware doesn't mean it's fine.They almost have the gauntlet off Thanos and Star Lord is about to ruin everything. Iron man decides to gently and politely ask him not to mess this up and to hold it in a little longer like a lil good boy instead of physically holding him off. They don't want to slice his arm off to remove the gauntletDoctor Strange gives up the time gem because it's the only way and that makes senseThere are at trillion nerves here but I shall remove the ones that link to the gem manually....We must sacrifice lives to save vision but we do not trade a life for a lifeGeneric horde army.They're about to go round the shield which covers the back as well.....OPEN THE SHIELD Hulk you wanna come out to play. Like a bratty teenager NOOOOOO.Where's the handle where's the handle......you make a very bad blacksmith Peter.Captain America says somethings happening and to group up on his location. Everyone except Thor with his axe is there for Thanos's arrival.Thanos is very reluctant to kill anyone before the end.Slow mo falling heroes is hilariousThe deaths seem painless yet Spiderman: I don't feel so wellBlack Panther: Get up this is no place to die..... did they want you to say something so badly before you went poof that they gave you that nonsense to say.No stakes movie because everything is going to be reversed.\n******I was not entertained or satisfied by the end of the movie.""]",/posters/xAvengers:.jpg

Maybe too great. It was the first time I\'ve ever had the music actually take me out of the experience. I often found myself thinking, ""These visuals aren\'t nearly interesting or important enough to justify this intense music."" Unfortunately, almost every action scene, and even the ""big moments"" like Han and Chewy sitting in the cockpit together for the first time, simply fell flat.There were plenty of explosions, but they forgot to pull us in with characters and a plot that we could care about.

That was just embarrassing. I couldn\'t help but laugh, not only because it was hilarious, but also as a way of venting the sudden awareness that my childhood fascination with these characters from a galaxy far, far away had just died.I couldn\'t watch more than 5 minutes at a time without re-writing lines of dialogue in my mind. Were they even trying at the script phase of production, or did they just scramble to get a bunch of words on the pages so they could get to the fun part of creating digital creatures and backdrops?Who knows?

Just like this movie doesn\'t matter.', 'The best part of this film is when the end credits come on!', '""Apollo 13"" director Ron Howard\'s ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" qualifies as an exercise in trivial pursuit rather than a sensational space odyssey in the thriving ""Star Wars"" franchise. Unfortunately, this frivolous, uninspired potboiler pales by comparison with the best: ""Rogue One."" Mind you, ""The Force Awakens"" featured captivating characters with far more impressive pyrotechnics than ""Solo."" Happily, the second ""Star Wars Story"" is neither as bombastic nor as pretentious as the execrable ""Last Jedi."" Unfortunately, ""Solo"" suffers from the problems afflicting prequels. Since we know none of the franchise leads--Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian--can die, the filmmakers generate only half as much suspense. The ill-fated characters that perish exert little impact in the greater context of events. Apart from prequel-itis, ""Empire Strikes Back"" scenarist Lawrence Kasdan and son Jonathan squander more time on penny-ante trivia about the eponymous character instead of fashioning a genuine, white-knuckled, escapade that might have propelled the franchise to greater heights. A mediocre B-movie, ""Solo"" is a routine crime thriller set among the stars. The best scene involves an elaborate but nerve-racking, roller-coaster train heist on a prodigious mountainside. Everything else seems superficial. At least one scene resembled the dudgeon scene in ""Return of the Jedi."" The aerial combat scenes with the Tie Fighters attacking the Falcon conjure up fewer thrills than the initial stand-off in the original ""Star Wars."" Han\'s adversaries project minimal menace. They fold like accordions in our hero\'s hands. Worse, they don\'t die spectacular deaths. You\'ll neither find a diabolical Darth Vader nor an arrogant Orson Krennic lurking in the background. A campy gargantuan octopus in outer space with teeth makes the depiction of the Kessel Run appear ludicrous rather than legendary. \n \nBasically, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" amounts to a laundry list of trivia serving as dots to connect the humdrum plot. Evidently, the people at Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Features, Imagine Entertainment, and Allison Shearmur Productions thought that depriving the title character of any shred of mystery would be indispensable for ""Star Wars"" aficionados. Why the Kasdans couldn\'t have made Han Solo into a livelier fellow still eludes me. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" never really gets under Han\'s skin, and the script seems intent on filling in the blanks of the Harrison Ford character as reincarnated by a different actor. Han Solo\'s younger version (Alden Ehrenreich of ""Heil, Caesar"") bears little resemblance to his lanky predecessor. Appropriately, he is an optimistic soul who hasn\'t attained the wisdom that years of hardship would later impart. Strutting about like Billy the Kid, Ehrenreich smiles too often to be taken seriously. Of course, everybody is bound to appreciate the irony when he utters the line: ""I\'ve got a good feeling about this."" If the film establishes anything, it is Han\'s naivety. He spends the entire movie fooling himself that he isn\'t the good guy, even when his passing love interest observes that he isn\'t a good guy. Arguably, the most controversial aspect that ""Star Wars"" purists will clamor about concerns Han\'s precipitant action in the final showdown with Beckett. For years, Lucas waffled about Han\'s clash with Greedo in the Mos Eisley Cantina. After altering it for the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ""Star Wars,"" he turned around and changed it again no less than twice. This minutia is the single thing that distinguishes this otherwise the somnolent saga.\n \nNevertheless, the filmmakers address a number of questions any ""Star Wars"" fan would love to know. Indeed, we learn how Han acquired not only his surname, but also won the Millennium Falcon while gambling with duplicitous Lando Calrissian during a game of Sabacc. Furthermore, we learn the circumstances of Han\'s chance encounter in a prison cell with Chewbacca. While most of the film sticks to the original details that have been part and parcel of the ""Star Wars"" film franchise as well as the Extended Universe of the ""Star Wars"" spin-off novels, Howard and the Kasdans have altered those circumstances for dramatic purposes. Originally, Han had been an Empire officer who had intervened on behalf of Chewbacca while a fellow Empire officer was torturing the Wookie. In ""Solo,"" the two are thrown together unceremoniously as prisoners in an oubliette, a prison that can only be accessed by a trapdoor in the ceiling. Nowhere in the film do the filmmakers account for Han\'s ability to converse with Chewbacca in the Wookie\'s own language. An important character, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers""), exists as a mentor who recruits Han into the big league of crime. Beckett furnishes Han with his distinctive firearm, a blaster pistol with a scope on it. A career criminal who refuses to trust anybody, Beckett wields probably the greatest influence over our protagonist. Earlier, we were told about the oppressive ""Oliver Twist"" like conditions that governed his formative years as a juvenile delinquent on the ship-building planet Corellia. Later, the details of the Kessel Run are fleshed out, but the schlocky space octopus sabotages any thrills. Remember, you cannot have suspense when you already know the outcome. \n \nApart from a tremendous train heist, ""Solo"" delivers little nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat, tension despite its lavish $250-million budget. When you consider how long ""Star Wars"" fans have awaited such an opportunity, it is hopelessly disheartening to have a film that winds up being such a superficial, sophomoric saga. The problems that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy encountered after she fired original co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of ""The Lego Movie,"" replacing them with Oscar winning helmer Ron Howard, who restaged three-quarters of the movie, undoubtedly must have exacted a dire toll on the film. Moreover, ""Solo"" amounts to the least picturesque entry in the franchise with some of the drabbest cinematography. Entire scenes have been photographed in sepia, so that faces, costumes, uniforms, and technology appear washed out against shimmering white backgrounds. Indisputably, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story,"" lacks the force that made the classic ""Star Wars"" adventures entertaining.', 'Is it because the cinematography is drab? Was that because of Ron Howard or Lord and Miller? Did Disney over \'disneyfy\' the franchise?All those are questions up for debate. What isn\'t up for debate? The claim \'Star Wars Fatigue\' is damage control. Bad damage control.If you\'re curious what an over budget train wreck looks like: this is the film for you. Otherwise relegate it to the same shelf as ""The Hobbit: Trilogy"" and recognize it for what it is - someone just cashing in on a lucrative franchise at the financial expense of those who love everything else about the franchise.', 'After ""Last Jedi""... I just don\'t care anymore about Star Wars. And so... this movie is just another on-going story... which I don\'t care.', 'I am not sure what to say. I am not a big fan of Star Wars and this is not going to change my mind I had nothing better to do last night so wandered into the cinema here in Ottawa. I am quite aware that Disney is milking Star Wars (like Marvel and so forth) and so this is a prequel or whatever, but even as a money making machine I feel they need to put a little more effort into these things.\nMy criticisms are that the film is too dark, as usual the girl beats up the bigger man no problem and most importantly they have no feeling in these things. Things run along their clichÃ© path and the acting betrays no feeling whatsoever. If my girlfriend and I were as distant toe ach other and had as little chemistry I am sure one of us would pack up and leave. \nDisney needs better stories, actors and directors. A little more originality is helpful because people are going to stop coming to these films.', ""If they take out any references and names from Star Wars and make this a standalone movie in its own universe, it can be a movie to watch before falling asleep.But as a Star Wars movie it's a joke, just like the rest that Disney spewed out since Episode 7 with no exception. It's a disservice to Star Wars fan and its sole purpose is to sell toys."", ""So so much potential utterly unexploited, thus delivering a vapid action film. It's a pity it had the Star Wars tag, or I might have given it 5 out of 10.\nWhere to start; bland action sequences, minimal character development, PC virtue signalling and dodgy timeline link in (bad guy from an earlier different film, no spoilers). It had them all. The film had me looking at my watch quite quickly. \nRogue One showed Star Wars spin offs can work, and add depth to existing characters, but this is how not to do it. I hope this will be a solo film but they were desperately lining up a sequel..."", ""Wow, really? I guess he had a strong case of writer's block. The movie is quite boring. Forced. Story, story, story! It doesn't have an interesting one! It didn't engage my interest enough and so I got confused in some parts. But it was still slightly better than I expected from that dull trailer. I liked seeing the stormtroopers...err...that's about it. The lead actor doesn't quite have it. I don't care for that style of cinematography...the movie is....meh...bland...I kept looking at my watch an hour in. I wonder why these writers are struggling?"", 'Overall the acting for the main characters is exceptional. However once a character more annoying, stupid, and pointless than Jar Jar comes in I lost all respect for the film. Disney stop throwing in your political opinions and make a decent movie.

There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer and lug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok."", 'Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel\'s version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It\'s not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don\'t need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn\'t be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that\'s entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn\'t perceive time as we do, he doesn\'t think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn\'t have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren\'t able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn\'t (couldn\'t) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that\'s it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there\'s no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it\'s as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it\'s true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn\'t get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn\'t good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I\'m exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it\'s absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I\'m sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn\'t a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you\'ll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we\'ll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...', ""If the movie can't be serious about an apocalypse and just goofs around in nearly every scene then its certainly the murder of Thor as we have seen in comics. One cannot emotionally connect to absolutely anything, death of Odin or Thor losing an eye or destruction of Mjolnir or extinction of Aasgard as we know it. Movie is perfect example of killing the plot with over use of humor, jokes is on us."", 'Was this movie a crappy comedy? Why so many people liked it so much? What was this movie about? What was the purpose of all the jokes? Is this only for kids?Things that bothered me: Ragnarok is supposed to mean the end of the ""world"" but no one took it seriously. Hela is about to conquer the world and kill everybody let\'s make a little joke. A fight started, oh, please, another little joke. Thor steps on a banana and falls down, ahahaha, funny. Loki - 0 power in all the movie, 0 spells, 0 abilities, just nothing, where was his power, he was so useless and did almost nothing in all the movie. Hulk - personality of a teenage boy on steroids. Thor - so funny, oh my god, joke after joke. Is he THOR or the kid of Deadpool?I had so high expectations but this movie targeted only the kids with all the not funny jokes.', ""I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie, but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most Marvel movies, the villains don't marvel."", ""(There might be some spoilers ahead but very vague.)I grew up with Marvel comics and Thor was always my favorite. None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing."", 'May be this is mostly targeted for children to teenage aged audiences. Humorous, colorful, C.G.I packed, with retro soundtracks. Making a comedy movie formula has worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool already, that doesn\'t mean that it has to be imposed in Thor too.Not bad if you have cheap tickets, but don\'t pay extra for IMAX/3D experience (we watched in 3D).**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD**Hulk\'s (and of course Dr. Strange\'s) character is somewhat forced into the film. Even his CGI looks cheap too.Odin, why bother casting him in the first place? The all-father, one of the most powerful characters of Thor franchise looks tired and bored to continue with the series.Valkyrie, is she supposed to be a musclebound warrior or some glamorous cat-walking (cheap) cosplaying model?Karl Urban, ""Executioner"" again.

The darkest story in Thor\'s history.So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It\'s quips, pratfall, anus jokes, Hela\'s kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thor helps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeat that in case I wasn\'t clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.It\'s just so bad.Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn\'t work in this movie.At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their main focus.Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU and will just pretend they\'re masterpieces when they\'re not. This movie was terrible.Critics call it ""FUUUUNNNN"". But it was just lame.I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burned it I still would have wasted money but I wouldn\'t have sat through this.It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be a bloated mess.', 'Real or not this movie is one hell of a journey! The story is truly serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can\'t count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ne ""Revengers"" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. The movie it\'s so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three Thor movies. Firstly because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it\'s also one of the best MCU movies. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard MARVEL fan I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you\'ll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his role in Ragnarok and there are some HUGE details that\'ll lead to Infinity War and you\'ll lose your mind when you see them. MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!', ""Whilst the movie was enjoyable I wasn't expecting a comedy. it is a slapstick comedy from Marvel or something that was created for school children. I know that you have to sell a product that doesn't mean you make an action movie or a hero movie Or a superhero movie do a total slapstick comedy full of puns and one-liners making me think I'm watching a 90s superhero movie with 2017 digital effects if you wanted to characterize this as a comedy and then probably I would have given in the higher score but since it was in my word superhero movies it deserves the lowest score that can be given the director was great but if this was meant to be a comedy nothing new or groundbreaking does not even compare to anything good only reason it is getting good reviews is because the rest of the movies in the box office are below par or not superhero movies.

Slot of missed opportunities."", 'I know some people are worried about the humour on this movie.But they used it excellently in this flick.This movie to me,is at least on the same level with Guardians of the Galaxy 1.I mean both guardians and Thor 3 made me laugh but never felt cringe or sensed any forced jokes.There were also very intense and emotional moments in this Thor movie.The fight sequences were so damn epic.When it comes to action,this movie is close to Lord of the Rings 2.They did a good job on reflecting the epicness of the Ragnarok event. The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty good job.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time. Tessa Thompson kinda surprised me with her great performance btw.', ""Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence, giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality."", ""After waiting for Thor: Ragnarok for years. This movie is perhaps, the WORST Marvel movie I have ever seen.Poor story-telling, weak character development, scenes felt out of place and total 360 from what Thor is supposed to have been.Hollywood blockbusters have been lowering the complexity of its stories to get more butts into the movie seats which include kids who might not be able to understand a more dark, realistic and complex story. This comes at the expense of adult audience who like to see a characters inits true form.This movie is basically Logan in reverse. It is a total betrayal of the character's true nature. The following are the movie sins committed in this flick; Warning Spoilers ahead!1) Bad Story-line.. This story doesn't allow characters to evolve or grow, a lot of the acting seems too familiar or forced for the sake of moving the movie forward or getting a reaction out of you.2) Everything happens so fast without explanation of events or relationships... a) Why did thor figure out that Loki was impersonating Odin now and not before? b) How was the all-powerful Odin enchanted by Loki? c) Why did Odin decide to let Hela to Invade Asgard and why did he decide to disappear? d) How did Hela break Thor's hammer? e) Why did the leader of Sakaar favorite Hulk over Thor?2) No setup from previous events and no purpose for charactersa) Thor and Hulk somehow ended up on the same planet by accident b) Why did Dr. Strange need to be in this movie besides setting up for a thor-strange relationship in a future Marvel movie? c) Why didn't Odin hint in previous films that thor had an evil sister named Hela? 3) Bad actingEven Tom Hiddlesto was off point, he had the usual devious smirk on his face but I sometimes wondered if he was expressing contempt at the directors of the film. Besides being a remarkable film crew with amazing actors, somehow this movie manages to bring out the worst acting of these stars.Heres a basic breakdown of each character Thor: A more emotional, funny and light-hearted ThorLoki: The same devious mischief with no new tricks up his sleeve, Loki is so predictable that even Thor has figured him out.Hela: The sorority club's biggest drama-queen, nothing mysterious or godlike about her. Even she falls into the joke frame.Heimdall: He had some good scenes and had a nice mystical look to him but wasn't very much useful in the movie.Grandmaster: This guy is supposed to be a ruler of a planet, instead he belongs on a SNL skit.Valkyrie: Independent strong woman, alcoholic, with both middle fingers up in your face. Somehow this quickly triggered ghetto character manages to defeat Loki in a battle for the sake of showing how women are strong too?Skurge: He betrayed Asgard for the whole movie and then tries to make up for it in less then 5 frames before he dies.Bruce Banner / Hulk: Even hulk manages to turn himself into a comedian.Doctor Strange: Earth's best sorcerer tools Asgardian gods such as Thor and Loki who should have far greater knowledge of magick then Dr. Strange.The Executioner: somehow managed to betray Asgard by serving Hela for the entire film, but then sacrifices himself at the end and we're expected to sympathize with this guy?Korg: This was a loony toons version of KorgTo seal the cherry on the cake, Thor basically lets and assists Asguard to be blown up to pieces, because he figures it will destroy Hela, someone who he wasn't able to defeat even with his new powers.The disappointment I felt after watching it sure caused a big disconnect for me after I came back home only to read all the positive reviews written by Critics and users alike, which made me question if these Critics are insiders, and if the users are in fact real accounts...I know everybody's got to make some money... but at what expense?"", 'EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THOR : RAGNAROKThe Movie was a total waste of time, the Hulk was shown to be with a child\'s mentality getting upset and doing children\'s moves.

The Hulk is Talking and no explanation is given for that he seems not angry anymore so why is he in Hulk mode in the first place.The second Stupid thing that the Marvel People didn\'t Even Bother to check was that in Thor the first movie Loki opened the Bifrost with the staff of ODEN (you can check the scene if you don\'t believe me) So how in HELL did Hela miss that knowing that she might be as ancient as Odin himself, not even once did she witness him open the Bifrost with his Staff?? They went to conquer the nine realms together so not knowing that is totally DUMB, if Loki knows it Hela should know it too.Before Loki screams ""BRING US BACK"" Thor say ""NO"" as if Hela couldn\'t reach Asgard without the Bifrost....? She appeared from HEL her Dimension into Midgard Earth without any Help why would she need the Bifrost to get There??? And if She so desperately needed the Bifrost for her conquest for the sake of argument she should have taken the sword the minute she landed on Asgard.AND How come the Devils ANUS gets you Directly to Asgard?? and if it does every time shouldn\'t the Grand Master know about it ? He seems not knowing what Asgard even is while his brother deals with Asgardians ??The Zombie Army is Stupid, they are slow, they are killable by simple asgardian citizens, what kind of an army is that?? Hela could conquer an entire planet by herself why would she need the dead weight.If Hela can\'t escape her Exile why did Odin send the Valkeries to finish her off in the first place ""knowing how powerful she is"" that was a dumb move on Odin\'s side. And we still don\'t know if Hela is bound to Exile because Odin is holding her off or how precisely because as mentioned before she can travel through dimensions at will. And if that\'s the case then she should be able to escape when Odin is weakened... say when he falls into the Odin sleep..?How did Odin abandon his responsibility as Protector of the nine realms and just went to Norway to enjoy the view is completely IDIOTIC and when confronted by his sons he just says ""it\'s your time now"" and vanishes?? He isn\'t injured, He is still capable of doing wonders but no he chose to turn into golden dust... That\'s pretty helpful thanks Odin.This movie went out of the frame that the fans and the Marvel Studios agreed upon, We expect action, a coherent story and good visual effects, if one of these elements is missing the movie sucks and frankly you should fire the scenario writers who put together Ragnarok because it\'s the Stupidest Movie Marvel Has Ever Made.', ""This is a goofball comedy, that contains high campery and pantomime villains, endless cheesy jokes at the expense of any real character or story development in place of any type of gravitas and epicness-ITS PERFECT.I personally don't like it and think it is a step in the wrong direction...."", ""Ugh, I really really hated this movie entirely. I was hoping for the heart of Wonder Woman or Lord of the Rings in Epic Quality, I got none of that. I honestly wanted to leave the theater, and mind you that is quite a feat to get me to not want to watch a film anymore. Last movie to hold this distinction of me wanting to leave the theater was that awful live action Scooby Doo movie. I was not wanting to see a comedy but an epic, Shakespearian Drama with realistic humor in small quantities in it like the first one was. I got none of that as well. The only thing I did like was Cate Blanchett as Hela. What bothered me the most was that people were getting killed and maimed by Hela but golly gee! Let's crack another childish joke!!!! Imagine if Game of Thrones was a juvenile comedy like this movie? Thank the Old Gods and the New that GOT is realistic in it's character portrayals. When all is said and done I am just not going to watch another Marvel movie in the theater again. I should have trusted my instinct and not gone like I did with Thor: The Dark World, but I stayed for my mother and that's all. If DC betrays me with Justice League I'm just swearing off modern comic movies altogether and just relying on all my old DVDs of the great Comic movies like the first 2 Raimi Spider-mans, Nolan's Batman movies and X2 to remind me when Comic Movies actually had heart, not the Chaching of the cash register. I felt like Ragnarok completely insulted my intelligence. I grew up with the Christoppher Reeves Superman, I still love the first two Raimi Spidey movies, and the first two X-Men movies as well as Nolan's Batman movies. All of these franchises had quality, intelligence and heart, not treated as a comedy to appeal to the stoner generation and their simple minds. Marvel has let me down and I refuse to waste my money and two hours of my life on unenjoyable experiences anymore so I refuse to go see another Marvel film in theaters.P.S. And here's the spoiler, can someone please tell me exactly why they unnecessarily made Hela Odin's daughter and not Loki's Daughter from the past as in the continuity that has been around for decades?

Jeremy has never been tagged-he is real athletic and has a super human Spidey sense as he moves like a ninja-and when Ed tells the rest of the gang that Jeremy is getting married and retiring from the game, they go all out in trying to get him before it\'s too late. During the end credits, they show the actual guys in action-I guess they used to film themselves at work-tagging each other in unexpected ways. One is caught in a shower and there is some brief nudity.\nIt\'s rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-brief nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.\nI enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.', 'How bad is Hollywood getting if these are the stories they are making into movies. Jon Hamm is awesome but wish he would choose roles that actually make him a better actor. Writers wake up and start writing interesting stories, not this silly garbage. Any actual men who do this are babies and very immature. So Sad.', 'I expected the crude humor but the the using of a miscarriage. Be warned!', ""This movie is funny, action packed, entertaining and based on a true story. The audience genuinely laughed out loud. I left there with a smile on my face and couldn't wait to come home and IMDB it to learn who everybody was. The guys all played so well off of each other and Isla Fisher added such a funny, wonderful spice to all the scenes she was in. I absolutely LOVED this movie:)"", ""I laughed a lot, great moments, fun movie with no boring moments, I love the way it was filmed, Hanibal Buress & Jeremy Renner were excellent! Also I love when Jake Johnson says she's to instense referring to Isla Fisher. One of the funniest scenes is when 3 of the cast are standing in a circle tagging each other that was hilarious, it's a all around great movie I'll probably buy it in 4K or Blu-Ray when it becomes available."", ""Tag has some genuinely funny moments, but much of the story drags out with a boring side romance and unfunny chases. This felt like a script written by committee to fill out 2 hours. I agree with other reviewers - the potential of the premise was wasted. That's not to say it wasn't fun. Most audience members were tagging each other while walking back to the parking lot. So the movie did awaken the inner child, albeit clumsily. I don't regret seeing it with my Moviepass, and would recommend it on a matinee if you have to pay full price.""]",/posters/xTagÂ (2018).jpg
The IncrediblesÂ (2004) ,(2004),8.0,1h 55min,"['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure']",PG,"A family of undercover superheroes, while trying to live the quiet suburban life, are forced into action to save the world.",Brad Bird,Brad Bird,"['Craig T. Nelson,', 'Samuel L. Jackson,', 'Holly Hunter']","['I finally saw Pixar/Disney\'s ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird\'s ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it\'s foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero\'s Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their ""bowling"" night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash\'s 4th grade graduation, that they keep ""creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity"".One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna \'E\' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome\'s genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.What also distinguishes ""The Incredibles"" along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen ""...I\'m not strong enough..."" Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as \'E\' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird\'s ""The Incredibles"" is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say.', 'I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it\'s suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn\'t do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don\'t feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don\'t believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop\'s Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don\'t cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don\'t trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children. The message I saw over and over again in the movie but could not find in a single review was how society was oppressing people to be no better than someone else. We seem to be headed towards embracing mediocrity, Harrison Bergeron, the short story by Kurt Vonnegut that was later turned into a film with Sean Astin, is the perfect example of someone smart being held back because it would hurt the dumb kids feelings to know there was someone better than them. The Incredible\'s attacks this head on, in one scene the villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes and remote controlled robots, tells Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) that he plans on killing all the truly empowered people and, using his inventions, become the only super hero until he\'s had his fun, at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone to become special ""which of course means no one will be"".Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have three children. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) can make herself invisible but only uses it to hide from a boy she likes, she\'s been broken down in spirit to feel like there is something horribly wrong with her and that she should be ashamed for being empowered with this amazing gift, to her it is a curse. Violet\'s younger brother Dash (Spencer Fox) on the other hand is angry with not being allowed to play in sports, because of his super speed, even though he promises not to show off. Their character development is some of the most in depth I\'ve seen for ""children"" in a film, in part because it\'s real, they face death and failure and they rise above their shame and anger to become real heroes.This movie is funny, it was honest, and it was one of the best films of the year. There is real development, there are real issues and real messages and at the end of the film I wanted to find the super hero in myself. I don\'t see why we should deny younger people, our children, the right to see something that is so beautiful just because of its honesty.', 'Wow. This isn\'t just the best animated movie I\'ve seen in a long time; it\'s one of the best movies, period. For sheer giddy enjoyment, stunning visuals, engaging characters. When the industry makes films with this much action and special-effects wizardry and a couple of big-name faces up front, they generally don\'t spend money on niceties like writing and character development. But Pixar, since they have something to prove with their computer-generated actors, has done the hard and loving work to infuse these cartoon characters with a humanity that most big-budget live-action movies don\'t match. Go see this one. Go see it for:Visuals. There is a reality to this picture that hasn\'t been present in previous feature-length CG movies. Hair, foliage, rust, water-all are executed very convincingly. You know these characters aren\'t human beings, but it\'s hard to believe that they aren\'t somehow real.Acting. The voice work is excellent, particularly Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson. The animators have done a great job capturing the subtleties of those performances in the motions of the on-screen avatars. If you saw the ill-fated Final Fantasy movie (of technical interest only, not really for the general public)-these cartoonish characters don\'t look as real, but they seem much more human.Bond References. There is an secret lair in this movie the likes of which Dr. No and Blofeld could only dream. Every Bond homage is pitch perfect, and we found ourselves laughing in an otherwise quiet theatre at the wonderful invention of the production design. Hey, we\'re movie geeks; apparently the others weren\'t. This movie is worth ten bucks for the modern architecture alone.Edna Mode. This character is the manic love child of 007\'s ""Q"" and Edith Head, and will surely be remembered as one of the great animated characters. She is voiced by the director, Brad Bird.I know I\'m not exactly going our on a limb here; the Tomatometer shows 96% as of this writing. But I wanted to see this movie again as soon as I left the theatre.Notes: This one is for older kids and adults, as the PG rating indicates.There are no ""outtakes"" in the end credits. (Anti-spoiler?)', ""Pixar has again proved that it's ethics and capabilities are inexterminable even for the tough-willed Dreamworks, which are gradually attempting to catch up on with standards. But with Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to superheroes. 9.5/10"", 'It\'s tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a ""superhero protection program"" and live the life of an Average Joe.This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the ""performances"", or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he\'s become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He\'s created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It\'s the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter\'s voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over.', 'In every review of *The Incredibles*, it has become a refrain: ""This movie could have worked as well in real life."" Big Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is a cone-shaped mountain of a guy, an ex-superhero doing time as a layperson in a world gone small \x96 from his office cubicle to his aspirations. Married to superheroine, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), like every husband, he sneaks out at night occasionally to hang with the boys \x96 in Bob\'s case, to fight crime as Mr. Incredible with his former teammate, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).Bob\'s two kids have inherited superpowers as well: son, Dash, super speed and daughter, Violet, telepathy and invisibility (think Phoenix from the X-Men). (A discussion on how the genetic combination of super-strength and elasticity in the parents would yield super-speed and invisibility in the offspring would get us nowhere.) This 3D-animation marvel is separated from its peers by its thematic thunder - sure, it gives us the usual ""familial values,"" but digs deeper by making the characters smart enough to ponder their roles as super beings in a mediocre world. The parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers/identities hidden and their children sheltered, but the kids don\'t understand why, raising Socratic questions about herd mentality and the conundrum of being ""created equal"" yet more gifted. Mom tells Dash, ""Everyone\'s special"" (which is its own special form of condescension) and Dash, instead of taking it like a Disney knockout punch \x96 as most kids in these ""family"" movies are inculcated to accept \x96 retorts (quite logically), ""Which is another way of saying that nobody is."" And when the action comes, it delivers in ways that even some live-action superhero movies do not. And by this I mean, the whole group uses their powers efficiently and intelligently, working together to combat their threats, rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves.And of course, there is the mandatory Group Hero Pose, perfected so gaily by N\'Sync during their two-month heyday. (Apologies to my more sensitive readers for using the ""N-word."") Jason Lee voices the villain, Syndrome, whom the family team must combat to Save The Day.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who does triple duty as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for the hero-conscious), the humor is wit, rather than slapstick, the heroism is moral rather than muscle-bound and the whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie - *The Incredibles* is as real a movie as a cartoon gets.', 'Maybe it\'s because I first saw this film six years after it was made, but I can\'t really see why such a big thing was made of it.I got an overwhelming feeling of ""is this it?"" when I saw it. That\'s not to say that this is a bad movie by any means, but there is nothing outstanding about it either. Of course, this could be said about a lot of films but is particular pertinent here when one considers the huge hype surrounding it when it first came out.It is quite an enjoyable tale about superheroes being forced to hide their identities, bring up families and fitting in until one day Mr Incredible gets the chance to relive the glory days...There are some very funny characters (Edna and Huph in particular) and most of the cast do their job well although Holly Hunter\'s lisp does get a little distracting after a while. Having the fifties titles and appearance is a nice touch which makes the whole film appear a little different from the norm.Like I said before, this is a good film, although if you haven\'t seen it before, try to forget all the hype surrounding it when it first came out.', ""Spoilers herein.All movies are about other movies. Most simply quote them, and most of these are bad. Some are very clever quoters, like Tarantino. But still mere quoters. A few weeks ago, I saw 'Van Helsing' which impressed the daylights out of me. It was all about transmutation at many levels including transmuting itself through several other movie identities.Meanwhile, I've been impressed by Pixar for other reasons. They've always been the leaders in folding and introspective dimensionality. Their logo even shows it: an illuminator jumps on the 'i', replaces it, looks around and then looks directly at you.In this film, their introspective experiments extend to quoting other films. But instead of the simple shopkeeping of Tarantino, we have appearances of other films but instead of being quoted they are re-imagined. Each transmutation is better than the original: This is better Bond than Bond, better Spy Kids than Spy Kids, better family drama than any recent experience. Better through-the-trees chase than Star Wars. Much, much better than 'Spiderman' and its ilk because it really understands pacing and manages ever-more unseen camera swoops.And it does everything it does with familiar images. For instance, the scene where Bob smacks his boss through several walls and he ends up wrapped in bandages and in traction is a collection of classic images from old cartoons, starting with the big guy grabbing the little guy. Except you don't notice that the big guy is the good guy. Never happens in the classics.There are two interesting folds here: the one that folds many movies genres as we mentioned and the one that conflates the folds of reality. Here's how this works: Usually there are two layers of a folded movie: the movie and some more abstract story within the movie. Spoofs depend on you knowing the layers, even if a layer isn't shown. So 'Austin Powers' has the intermediate level of Bond, even though it doesn't have an explicit segment that exists in the world of Bond. Ted's law says the folding distance must be equal, so the abstraction between the real world and that of Bond is exactly the same as that between Powers and Bond, extra cartoonishness if you wish.This Pixar project has two levels squashed into the same world. One level is the very realistically abstracted story between Bob and Helen. This isn't very cartoonish at all compared the regular world of cartoons. Then you have the superhero world which Bob and later Helen dive into; this is the most extremely abstract world of cartoons. Three levels, us, Bob and Helen as people (and they seem more real in this mode than most 'real' characters) and Bob and Helen and kids as superheros.The novelty of the fold is that these are squashed together as if there is no distance. That (plus some very human-like camera angles and the 'interview' footage at the beginning) squashes the world of the viewer into what we see. Its the kind of brilliant novelty that can only be done by close students of the art.A side comment that follows: the standard Disney cartoon has to have an obvious moral. Parents enthusiastically use this as a sad excuse for parenting. This film puts the moral in the spoof level. That means, folks, that it is equating it to the mediocre fictions Bob berates at the beginning. To distract the dopes in the audience, they do damage control by splicing an 'ordinary' moralistic dippy thing at the beginning.The real moral is that most movie houses have 'insurance:' they test their films into mediocrity. Pixar does no testing. They figure it out and trust their geniuses. Along the way, they take two heavy hits in the story at insurance companies who literally put superstars out of business, and incidentally steal from the worthy. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."", 'Superheroes have to go into hiding ala the witness protection program after civilians start to take advantage by suing the gifted ones in crazed lawsuits. Now all superheroes must live as their alter egos in a world where having special powers is frowned upon all of a sudden. The patriarch of the titled family though becomes the target of a deviant individual who was once his biggest fan. Thus it is up to his family to save him so the group can save the world once more. ""The Incredibles"" is strong with its animation, but honestly the story is hit-and-miss. Hanna and Barbara-styled ideas from the 1960s and 1970s mix with that dark comic book look that was so prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s to form a long (and I do mean long) cartoon that suffers an identity crisis with its tone and pace. The characters have their moments, but most are not as interesting as they look. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that definitely has more upside than down because of its glossy look and hot visuals. However, I still think that a little more time could have been spent on the script and on the movie\'s potential uniqueness. Unfortunately, ""The Incredibles"" really pales to most recent computer generated productions. 4 stars out of 5.']",/posters/xThe.jpg

Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother deal, not unusual but not too sappy.

He orders her around and expects her to do as he says, tells her not to go to parties, threatens boys who want to date her, and gets into fights over her. There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over something they have said to Elle, and then he screams at Elle to get into his car.

Noah, who was the love interest of the main character, was very controlling even before they were in a relationship. On the other hand, the main character was just as bossy. There were a lot of cringe-worthy moments in this movie, especially with a lot of lines and with the party scene.

Whenever I thought I would find a great movie like this one I kept getting let down and started losing hope for a bit. I almost didn't even watch this movie, but already 10 minutes into the film, I knew it would be great. It has a great combination of your favorite movies from the 80s and 90s and a modern day love story. The casting is great and the chemistry between the characters is great and very understandable as the main love interest is dating in real life. At times, some scenes were slightly cheesy, but overall the film was solid. I even felt that the cheesy scenes fit well with the movie and balanced out nicely. I believe this film was truly amazing and is one of the best, if not the best, coming of age/teenage films I have seen. I think that the people rating this film poorly have never liked this genre of film because they would love it if they did. I greatly enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend that you watch whenever possible because it will not let you down when you do.""]",/posters/xThe.jpg

 Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she discovers the island where her father disappeared.",Roar Uthaug,Geneva Robertson-Dworet,"['Alicia Vikander,', 'Dominic West,', 'Walton Goggins']","['Angelina Jolie brought the highly popular video game to the big screen. Her versions were campy, cheesy and ridiculous - but they were a far cry better than this new version of Tomb Raider.This Tomb Raider had two very good games (recently updated) to use as resource material and it looks like the only thing that they used was the idea of the island, the ship crashing on the rocks and the look of Lara Croft. The screenwriters ignored all the great characters that were in the game that would have brought this to life, they ignored the fact that a ship needs a crew (ridiculous point number one: one person manning an entire ship), they ignored the entire Trinity aspect of the game, they ignored all the good puzzle solving techniques, they ignored the fact that Lara was wealthy and trained herself in martial arts and weapons.This movie starts out with Lara sparring and she is awful at fighting. Why? Why would you make her awful at fighting when that is the entire basis of the Tomb Raider series - that she can fight and is a strong woman who can defend herself. They have three teenage boys basically frighten her off - so she is afraid of three teenagers, but minutes later is hitting everyone (trained mercs) with a bow. The father/daughter subplot was useless and not needed in this film. It was an aspect that drug the film down. And of course, the usual find daddy alive all these years and only to have a negative outcome.The script was horrible. The writing was so juvenile and nothing was explained or written well. The direction was terrible. The acting was dreadful. The only positive was that Vikander looked the part - that was the only positive.Don\'t believe the hype that the ""paid critics"" were given money to falsely promote this film. You would be better served playing Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider - you would be more entertained watching the cut scenes from those two games on your computer than watching this boring garbage.', 'As someone who spends much of their free time surfing through Netflix originals, my standards are about as low as standards get. However, this movie surpassed nearly all of them - in the worst way.First, characters: Lara is an infallible God who is apparently immune to physical injury and flawless in every way. Lara is the opposite of relatable - she can leap over 30 foot gaps and climb up slippery rock faces with an open stab wound. She can swim against impassible currents but struggles to do a pull up at several points in the movie. Her skill with a bow rivals every man with a machine gun that she encounters. Every side character in the movie only serves to move Lara forward in her mission. Most of the characters were completely flat and did not change from the beginning of the movie to the end. Lara was always adventurous and brave. The villain was always hellbent on destruction and gaining control of the disease.Then, script: The script was heinous. One of the lines was something like, ""the tomb isn\'t meant to keep us out, but to keep us in."" Several people in the theater laughed in response, but I doubt that was the intended reaction.The plot was stereotypical, boring, and we\'ve all seen it before. Miss this movie and buy yourself a nice dinner. Trust me.', 'Amazing start, good action, deep enough character development. After 30 minutes the production becomes completely predictable and starts following the cliche guidelines of an low budget movie designed to ""kill time"" for the average house wife.Despite Alicia Vikander\'s great performance going further the story becomes extremely boring, I assume sensed by the director, who decided to flood all milestones in it with too much drama and extremely irritating 80s-cheap-movie dramatic music.On top of everything else, the film deviates from the game story completely.Well, it is not a total wreck but if you have played the game and enjoyed it even a little, you do not need to suffer this glorified hiccup of a production.', ""It's an okay action movie if you want to pass a couple of hours. But it's not great and it's not worth a second viewing.I went in open minded and wanted to like this, but ultimately I was disappointed in Vikander's casting, as she is lacking in both stature and personality. She is weak and wooden and dull as Lara Croft, and unfortunately can't hold a candle to Jolie, who was magnificent, exciting, charming, captivating and perfect in the role.The storyline is also lacking - a spoiled crybaby daughter looks for her Dad. Yawn. This film steals lots of ideas and scenes straight from the game, but doesn't add anything new to them. You might as well just play the game, as playing it is more fun than watching this."", ""Best game I played and worst movie I watched. queen's army, her ability just been cut in the movies. the story is totally empty."", ""First of all, Alicia is outstanding. She could perfectly fits the game plot....could.Changes in the original game plot begins when there are two people in the boat, instead of the original number in game. This was not a problem, until Lara reaches the island.The game ending shows Mathias as the evil character. Why the movie brought him as the killer of Lara's father right in the beginning? When you think that it couldn't get worse, Lara finds his dad. What is his role in the island(???????)? From this to the end, it's a completely disrespectful plot for all the gamers who played the game. If the changes were even good....Samantha Nishimura was literally excluded from this movie while she co-stars the game. Lara's friends were essential to build her personality during the game, and also it was excluded.Also, Lara unique scene reaching a tower to send a SOS signal was excluded. It had such photography potential......what to say about the island? It is so amazing when its atmosphere gets scary when Lara and her friends try to get out of the island.Maybe next time it would be better to put a gamer closer to the movie project.....My recommendation is: if you liked the movie, go and play the game right away....see what it could be."", ""I'll keep this very simple, slapping the name Tomb Raider does not give permission to make a crappy movie and expect people to pay for it.\nThis movie had plenty of plot holes, the chosen Lara Croft was not the best choice and the CG in this trashy movie is cheap."", 'Tomb Raider has got to be one of the most boring and by-the-numbers action/adventure films I have ever seen a long while. I don\'t think I came this close to falling asleep during a movie since The Last Witch Hunter.The main actress was good but not great, I\'ll admit, but everyone else was serviceable at best and nothing to write home about. Except Nick Frost as the Pawn shop clerk. He was pretty cool.However, the characters were utterly uninteresting and boring. Lara is every boring missing-parent protagonist rolled into one bland package. When I first heard that the mother died, I nearly facepalmed, in utter disbelief that it is 2018 and we are still putting the bare minimum effort into our video game adaptations. Both the Father and villain feel like they just took character templates from better movies and made no effort to flesh them out or make them unique.The story was, you guessed it, a bore. Everything up until they reach the island felt like generic filler that was lifted from better movies and really should have been cut down. It did not help make me any more invested in this character. The rest of the movie plays out like a EXTREMELY watered down and childishly predictable Indiana Jones side quest with none of the charm, wit, or intrigue.The action was unremarkable. Not good, but not bad either. Nothing memorable or noteworthy. Ditto for the soundtrack.The only aspect of this film that even remotely caught my interest was the revelation that Himiko\'s ""death powers"" was actually a very fatal disease for which she was a carrier, and that she actually sacrificed herself to protect her people (contrary to the myth where she was an evil witch who was entombed by her own generals). Plot points involving the supernatural having rational explanations in grounded-in-reality films do interest me. This feels like the only element in the movie that had any effort or thought put into it.But upon learning that this was NOT the case in the video game this movie was based on, but rather from an entirely separate franchise altogether, I could not help but laugh at the irony. I guess the actual concept from the video game was too ""original and risky"" for these filmmakers?All and all, Tomb Raider was a boring and cliche-ridden chore of a film that plays it completely safe and makes no effort to set itself apart from any number of adventure films and video game adaptions. It\'s literally a bunch of cookie-cutter template characters taking part in a cookie-cutter template adventure without an original bone in its limp body. I have never played the game that this film is based on, but if it really is as bad as this film, then it will probably stay that way.3/10.', 'Wait to see the Golden Raspberry Awards of this year. Tomb Raider will be there for sure! This CRAP deserves the highest prize in every category! Worst Script, Worst Acting, Worst Direction! Worst everything! You will REGRET paying for this garbage and ruining your weekend. DO NOT read all the fake reviews on this site or elsewhere! WORST MOVIE you will see in your life!', ""Don't waste your time and your money watching this. You will regret it. Ridiculous, a pile of garbage. There's nothing in this movie you will remember after you walk out of the theater. I hope it gets several of those awards they give to the worst movies ever made, because it deserves it."", 'Seriously this is like some kind of 1930\'s soviet world where all of a sudden people start getting cropped out of photos. Laura Croft without her signature pistols is absurd. \nI have no trouble with Vikander, she is a great actor. but having her, with an unsighted composite bow (!), make bow shots that are impossible at 1/10 the range, treats the audience like idiots.\nSeriously this film does not merely require that you suspend disbelief, it is a fight film which requires that: a) you know nothing whatsoever about fighting and b) that you have an IQ below 80. (hence all the ""8"" through ""10"" star reviews by people so dumb that they think we can\'t see their only account activity is to upshill this stinker!)', ""Cast is bad. Scenario is bad. Its like for stupid people. I quit after they find tomb. I waste my one hour. I don't recommend this movie. And she is also doesn't fit for the role. We miss you Angelina Jolie."", ""I'm sort of wandering how old a movie has to be when they decide that it is time for a remake. Well, I'm actually thinking that it is getting less and less the further we progress because I'm sure that the Angeline Jolie Tomb Raiders were only out a few years ago. In fact, when I first saw the advertisements for this instalment a part of me thought that it was just Angelina reprising her role, only to be rather baffled when I discovered that Lara Croft was actually being played by a completely different actress. In fact, it became quite clear when I watched the preview a second time (as I wasn't really paying attention the first time I saw it) that I realised it was a reboot.\n Honestly, I'm not all that sure why it is I go and watch these movies because as it turned out this one was pretty bad. Well, not really, but I certainly wasn't able to get into it. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that really enjoy these films, but all I can say is that it is basically unoriginal. Okay, it is a reboot, and reboots are never original, but then again they never end up being all that successful either, especially when the original was so much better. Actually, I sometimes wonder why Hollywood insists on rebooting and remaking successful films when it is quite clear that it rarely, if ever, works.\n Okay, it has been a while since I've seen the original Lara Croft film, and it also seems that I never got around to writing a review for it either, so it makes it difficult to compare. However, here we start off with Lara as a bicycle courier in London, and she seems to forever be getting herself into trouble. Well, once again it is the story of the abandoned child since her father went off on an adventure seven years ago and is now presumed dead. So, Lara decides that she might as well sign the papers, only to discover a piece to a puzzle that sends her on a round the world adventure.\n As I said, it is difficult to compare the two films since in this one it seems as if she is a bit of a newbie when it comes to adventuring, and it is the hunting down her father plotline (which a part of me believes that was the original film as well). In a way, I thought that maybe she would have been a bit more skilful, though I guess that would make it a little unrealistic as it is also supposed to be a coming of age type of film, and in another sense a passing on the baton.\n There were a few interesting plot points as well, namely because it deals with a legendary Japanese queen known as the Death Queen, and we are all led to believe that she is an evil sorceress who was banished to an island and imprisoned in a tomb because she was, well, so evil. However, the hint is dropped that legends aren't always what they seem to be, though that does not necessarily mean that they are completely false. In fact the truth behind the legend may be much more fantastic.\n Still, this is probably not a film that I would be going out of my way to recommend. It was okay, but in the end nothing that really stands out. I guess it is probably more like one of those mindless films that you watch when you really don't want to think, and have basically watched all of the Indiana Jones films to death, but still want something that is of the same style. Sure, Indiana Jones is just way too hard to beat, sometimes it is good to have something that is a little different (though you generally know what is going to happen at the end). I should mention that they have left the film open to a sequel."", ""The pros:\neffects and action scenes are beautifully done. \nMainly focuses on rebooted game but has elements of older games.The cons:\nThe character development in this movie is a rich girl finally signing a paper to get her inheritance.\nThe first 20 minutes of the movie is spent doing random stuff in London.\nDaniel Wu's character is useless and added nothing.\nThe main mystery borrows from the most recent Tomb Raider but simplifies it and makes it boring. \nLots of logical fallacies.\nPuzzle scene had potential but wasn't well done."", 'This is not Lara Croft. This character is a Greenpeace wannabe college dropout.This movie reboot is about as close to the Tomb Raider franchise as ""Mario Kart Adventures the Movie"" would be. Half the time Lara Croft isn\'t sure where she should be or what she has to do next. THAT is about as close as the movie gets to the game.\nThe main character comes across as a weak snowflake with daddy issues. NOTHING like the game Lara at all.\nSorry but this was a poor and unforgivable Howard the Duck of a movie considering the money spent.', 'I will admit that I was a bit hesitant in watching this movie in the beginning but it was really a pleasant surprise. I love the actress and the whole movie was amazing. It reminded me a lot of the amazing games I used to play!', ""Finally we got one good motion picture which is well adapted from a game. Alicia Vikander is awesome as Lara Croft. Yes, we tend to compare it with Angelina Jolie's version but this movie turns out much better. I truly enjoyed Angelina Jolie's 1st Lara Croft which was over-the-top but enjoyable but this one is more grounded and real. It has few cliche moments but amazing action sequences, great VFX, wonderful story-line makes up well for everything. I am so happy that finally we got a motion picture well adapted from a game. This movie is largely based on 2013 Tomb Raider game and some action sequences reminds me of Uncharted series...

Didn't you guys see the last fight between T'Challa and Erik Killmonger? What kind of CGI was that? Well, maybe you were sleeping by that time. 'cause why not, the story was completely boring, predictable, and cliched. There wasn't any plot whatsoever. The characters were so shallow and undeveloped that you can't even care for any of them. People die and you don't even care. And of course, let's not forget the ''acting'' This movie harbors the cringiest actors in the universe. Their accent was killing everything. Probably you guys won't believe it but I was giggling while some dramatic scene was going on. It was just bad.End credit scene was better than the whole movie."", 'This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not, I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys.', 'Terrible. 3 at best. Dialog is awful. Accents are worse. How in the world can this be rated so high?', 'People made this film up to be the best marvel film of all time, some of the cgi in this film was ATROCIOUS, sound track was mixed and horrible, and the concept of the film was over all stupid.""so like we have this resource called vibranium, it never runs out and it fuels our entire society""it wasn\'t worth going to the theater to see african tribal people spear fighting over popcorn. The only reason it has 2 stars is because it had a connection to the rest of the marvel universe which is well established, and filmography wasn\'t bad. but of course filmography is good, its a MARVEL movie', 'With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren\'t remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:\nEffort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn\'t like:\nThe story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don\'t know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan\'s character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren\'t African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn\'t remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn\'t see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn\'t see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn\'t even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan\'s character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther\'s character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn\'t be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn\'t fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out.', ""Something must be wrong here! This is not a good movie at all.\nBoring and cringy, an SJW fail. Black Panther was quite cool in Captain America, but don't be fooled. I'm sorry I paid for this, spare your money and don't support this crap or they will make more crap."", ""Seriously - WHY does Hollywood think that film lovers do NOT want characters to have a value? Both old and young people want to fall in love with the characters in movies - or the opposite for antagonists. In this movie they spend maybe 30 seconds building up the characters, if even that. They just assume that we will have feelings to any character who pops up in the movie - BUT WE DON'T. If anyone fights, almost dies and in the end dies anyways we just do not care since we do not get to know the person. Forrest Whitaker acts is but off yet you do not care if he dies... WHO is he, tell us something about him before please (!).Same thing goes for the rest. Seriously, a movie with 99% effects and 1% emotions is NOT a good balance.AND WHY ARE ALL CHARACTERS 100% STEREOTYPE??PS. They killed off the one character who did a good job acting:ANDY SERKIS, we all love you bro! Hope that you somehow come back in the next Marvel shajt-movie."", 'Sadly I had big expectations for Black Panther as a HUGE fan of Black Lightning TV show, I was looking forward to this release only to be dismayed.At best it is a movie made with 90% green screen sequences but in reality it is a discombobulated mash of garbage that takes way too long to develop any story whatsoever and that storyline is as thin and weak as a nightclub whiskey, left stale overnight and re-poured.The hype is over-rated and the movie is ultimately disappointing. May appeal to Millenials who exist without a functioning braincell.', ""I watched this movie specifically based on the IMDB rating but I feel that the initial reviews to get this movie rates above 8.0 were faked. Whilst IMDB originally was genuine it seems it has fallen foul of the capitalist system and no longer has impartial reviews. Avoid this move it's sooooo bad I can't believe the ratings."", ""This movie was just way too overrated. The fighting was not professional and in slow motion. I was expecting more from a 200 million budget movie. The little sister of T.Challa was just trying too hard to be funny. The story was really dumb as well. Don't watch this movie if you are going because others say its great unless you are a Black Panther fan or Marvels fan."", ""Shame I can't rate this 0/10.Movie could of been good if not for some people clearly pushing a political opinion but in the end everything was awful, the timing of the jokes, no expression or any kind of physical comedy when saying the jokes, everything was just awful.Could of tried to make it a little bit less obvious that is movie isn't really about the movie at all lol.I was excited for this, but honestly, worst film I've watched in a long time. Hatchet was better and that was a mere time killer and awful at the same time. I wouldn't even watch this again if I was in a hospital bed, rather be in silence and doing nothing."", 'If I were able to post a one or two word review, it would either be agenda or uncanny valley. Everything I feared this film would do, it did. Indeed in a couple of places it even referred to the (*spoilers*?) the slave trade! Seriously? In the 21st century you are going to refer at least twice in the same film to the slave trade - which BTW if you follow the film\'s premise would NOT have affected Wakanda as they were cut off from the rest of the world!The main character of the film is T\'Chala - a character so depressingly dour and serious, he could be a candidate for depression. You have his younger sister - who is CLEARLY being geared up as effectively riri from the comics - she WILL be the replacement for Tony Stark! To best describe her, she is a light hearted Q from thee James Bond films - I liked her, she was fun, lively, bright, as a character a real find.Andy Serkis was excellent, but far too underused - Michael B Jordan\'s ""big bad""? I understand the anger, I don\'t get his ultimate goal - makes NO sense. The female bodyguards were the nearest thing to Mary sues in the movie. Really - beating up men TWICE their size with the SAME military background?I MUST discuss the CGI. This is a MASSIVE problem.Sure Wakanda looks spectacular, but so did Asgard. It\'s the motion of the main characters that is the problem. It seems that whilst they can get stationary objects (buildings etc) virtually spot on now, the same can NOT be said for dynamic ones. If you have watched any of the trailers, you\'ll know what I mean when you see Black Panther do his somersault The dynamic CGI characters look crystal clear, whilst the real life objects have a faint blur to them. You can just see where the live action starts and the CGI ends. If the cars were CGI as well you wouldn\'t notice the difference so much, but it IS there, and because it seems 90% of this film is CGI, in the end it becomes very annoying.as for the claim that this is unlike any other Marvel film - I beg to differ - unless you refer to how insular the whole film is, as it is based almost entirely in Wakanda. Which could be acceptable, until you realise most of the action took place outside of wakanda - in the remaining 5-10% of the film!Winter Soldier was CONSIDERABLY better than this. Guardians was better and more fun! Avengers had greater scope.Ragnarok was funnier.I know EXACTLY who this film was geared for, and it was NOT for your typical Marvel comic book movie fan. it had good points, The tech wiz sis has major potential, Wakanda looked spectacular (if you ignore the poor water animations (the ripples in the water looked cut and paste, watch MOANA for how water can be animated!) The soundtrack bore no relation to the action (action scenes sounded the same as the quiet moments!). But the worst ""crime"" was the agenda it pushed. There is NO Excuse for this, as they PROVED they can have strong storyline in Winter soldier.So if you want a film with a dour dreary lead character, lots of uncanny valley moments, and LOTS AND LOTS OF POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING with no payoff, then this is the film for you!Just remember The Godfather / Goodfellas / Star Wars / Schindler\'s List all barely broke 90%, yet THIS is supposed to be 100%! If you don\'t think the ratings for this are agenda driven, I\'ve got a bridge to sell you!I do NOT want a Black Panther 2 - I think the days of single super hero movies are done', ""Not in the mood to write a huge review. Bottom line, it's just another superhero regurgitation - nothing new or special about it.

Positive reviews had also whetted the appetite. Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn\'t feature anything we haven\'t seen before. What is most disappointing, is that it doesn\'t seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a ""Black Panther tale"" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn\'t we have toned it down just a little?I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity.']",/posters/xBlack.jpg

This is not a bad movie, it\'s just not as good as it could\'ve been. There are multiple points where they set up something that seems like it could be really cool, but never quite pay it off. This movie has a really cool premise, it\'s got a nice grimy but sleek style to it, and filled with Interscope characters. Jodie Foster is incredible, and Dave Bautista steals the show when he\'s on screen, but again it never quite reaches the peak of what it could\'ve done with these characters. So while you don\'t need to rush out and see it, I\'d still give it a chance because at the very least it is quite entertaining.', ""This movie is definitely worth seeing. I am shocked at what critics are saying, and shocked at how little it's making at the box office. This movie is more fun than other reviewers or critics are suggesting. It's very funny with some (finally) witty dialogue, good casting choices, and an original plot that manages a twist done well. Every character has a purpose and appropriate character development, which is really impressive. This is the kind of movie I want to see more of at the box office and am willing to pay to see. I recommend others go see it opening weekend or anytime it's out to encourage further original films such as this to be made."", 'I really liked the premise of this --10 years in the future, a nurse runs a covert hospital for criminals in downtown L.A., but what you get is some run-of-the-mill heist gone wrong, gotta find a way outta this tight spot narrative that goes exactly where you think it\'s gonna go. It\'s cool to look at, Jodie Foster and Jeff Goldblum are excellent despite their dull lines, and Bautista\'s character is actually a lot of fun. But, \'Hotel Artemis\' is definitely not the ""high-octane action-thriller"" it\'s being marketed as. The coolest action scene comes at the tail-end of the movie, which makes you wonder why they didn\'t do that kinda stuff the whole time.', ""'Hotel Artemis' is the third film ever to be distributed by Global Road Entertainment, it also happens to be Drew Pearce's directorial debut for a feature length film. It stars the likes of Jodie Foster, Sterling K. Brown, Sofia Boutella, Jeff Goldblum, Charlie Day and Dave Bautista. Going into this movie I had no idea really what it was about other than the few tweets I saw on Friday when it opened. I had not seen a trailer nor did I read into this film, but I went into it pretty excited nonetheless. 'Hotel Artemis' is set in 2028 Los Angeles during one of the worst riots in U.S history. It centers around Jodie Foster's character who runs a hotel that is meant to patch up and take care of the most elite criminals. From here we have a movie that offers some quality suspense, good performances all around and a decent plot.  'Artemis' as I previously stated has quite the well-rounded cast. Jodie Foster in this movie is quite good, Sterling K. Brown is also really good in this movie, he plays one of the criminals there to get service from Foster. Sofia Boutella plays probably this movie most exciting character and she really played her role well. At times these performances, especially the ones from the criminals, came off as comical or cartoony. I think after processing this film that Pearce and the other filmmakers who worked on this were actually going for that. Dave Bautista is pretty cool in this movie. He plays the hotels security and works alongside Foster. His and Foster's character have quite good chemistry and it was the most believable of the movie for sure. Foster did a really good job at setting the tone of this hotel and what it's all about. I had a hard time being invested in these characters because of the lack of overall development. The characters are for the most part interesting but without any developed arcs, as well as the subplots that just felt useless, I really did not care much for these characters. Jeff Goldblum is pretty awesome in this movie and his talents were put on display once again...(SPOILERS AHEAD, you have been warned, skip to next paragraph)...for about 2 minutes! Yea! They killed off this movie's most intriguing character after maybe three or four minutes tops screen time. It felt like Goldblum was in town and they put out an alert saying we need someone to come by the studio for half an hour! His character felt so wasted in this and that was a disappointment. (SPOILERS DONE) Pretty much the entirety of this movie is spent in this hotel so it is important that they set a good vibe in there, and thanks to how Foster portrayed the hotel as well as the set design, I was rather pleased and drawn into the world of 'Hotel Artemis.' It was a neat estranged setting and it was quite entertaining to be a part of. The intensity in this movie is build up pretty well but without a sense of payoff. The final parts of this film were somewhat rushed in my opinion and it hurt this movie in terms of emotion and intensity, however, this was still a lot of fun to watch. The main fight sequence was really fun in this movie and it was choreographed very well but because of no connection being developed with the characters in this movie for me, it's essentially just mindless fun. Overall, I was much more interested in this World and hotel not the actual characters and subplots."", ""I don't think I have seen a bigger waste of talent in a motion picture, EVER. There are strong actors in this film, but the writing and directing are so weak it's wasted. Zack and Jeff had an amazing opportunity, but their talent and story was completely wasted. Jenny and Charlie really did nothing to drive the story forward and could have been removed all together. The story really rests on Sterling shoulders, but he has no support and his character is poorly written. Jodi isn't believable in her role, wasting again, another talent. Dave is good, but again, he needed more support from Jodi, which he didn't get. I gave this title 5 out of 10, but that is generous. The set design was also poor, most like a result of a low budget. I felt like I was watching a play. Nothing about what I saw felt like a hotel. In John Wick, I felt like I was checking in with John and that I was in a real hotel, this movie comes off more like a direct to video feature. You have been warned, this movie is a waste of your time, money and effort."", 'Oh boy does this movie start strong. And the premise is brilliant, but it can\'t sustain itself, and in the end it felt like an anemic crawl to the finish line.The movie is of a hotel run by nurse who is haunted by her past, and drinks to alleviate emotional pain. Jodie Foster plays the unnamed nurse simply named The Nurse. The hotel is a cover for a patch-up place for high-level criminals. Imagine a hi-tech low-rent dump used for the recovery of the scummiest of the scums of the world. EXCEPT...they aren\'t really all that evil. Or haven\'t proven it (fail #1). Sterline Brown plays Waikiki, a lifer criminal who finds himself back at the hotel after a botched crime. There he reunites with a past flame Nice (like the French city) played by Sofia Boutella.Without getting into too much of these plot, because there isn\'t really much there...the script really doesn\'t do much with their backstory either, the true hero here is Jodie Foster. With her babbling non-descript colloquialisms, we learn she is the true heart of the place. The owner is a big time scary crime boss who just so happens to have been injured one night (fail #2). Also, though it doesn\'t have many characters, I was a little shocked how much mystery even the closest of relationships become throwaway characters. You leaning forward to get some glimpse of warmth where none is delivered. It\'s aggravating and frustrating and will turn many people off.Sadly, this story is CRUSHED by its style as well. The relationship of the hotel\'s security Everest (Dave Bautista) and her are the most touching. And this leaves you wanting more of their banter and closeness. But this movie wants to be tough and resists sentiment. Too bad. We saw this before in ""John Wick"" at their hotel. Whilst there\'s was closer to a true downtown Los Angeles sophisticate syndicate, the Hotel Artemis is fine being the run down Art Deco grim step-sister.\nTo me...this movie really needed to be a mini-series. It seemed like borrowed sets with borrowed bits and pieces of previous (better) movies. And in the end, you\'re left with no reason that it needed to be made.\nIn this instance...it does not live up to what it sets up. The stakes are set up as high but seem to be easily overcome. It\'s an odd movie.\nIf Jeff Goldblum is why you go see this movie, prepare to be disappointed. His presence, is grim and confusing. And he enters too late to fix the problems of a substance-less flick.\nWhat a shame.', 'An incredibly misleading movie, not as represented in the trailers. Barely any action, more of a drama with tons of talking and boring dialogue. So many wasted moments and plot elements. Every chance to have a cool conflict the lamer of two choices is selected. This results in an utterly predictable and boring movie with a promising concept and visuals that fails to deliver. The fact that they are trapped in an ultra violent riot where protestors armed with rocket launcher are fighting militarized police and this never seems to affect the plot in any significant way is almost a crime. The only two gems are Charlie and Bautista, both of whom are hilarious. Other than that give this boring slog is not worth the trouble. Maybe a rental.', ""Hotel Artemis (2018) \nDirector: Drew Pearce \nWatched: June 10, 2018 \nRating: 3/10 Assasins' hotel- \nViolent noir thriller, \nVisually pleasing- \nFoster leads the show with zeal, \nPromising cast and premise.

My somonka will be a love/hate letter to a film? \n#Somonka #PoemReview #LostPotential"", 'We are Jodie Foster fans, and we were looking forward to this addition to her filmography. Sad to say, it was one of the worst films (in our opinion) we have seen. The writing did not hold together well; the characters were inconsistent and poorly developed, the casting did not work, and the acting was disappointing. It was a shock, as we do not expect to see this caliber of performance in a movie featuring Ms. Foster. The concept of the movie had good potential, and could have been quite a movie. A shame.', 'Tongue in cheek acting choice killed a good idea. See how ""The Expanse"" or ""Banshee"" took themselves so seriously that made most scenes a thrilling experience. Instead we got not too funny jokes, not too harsh violence or technically arresting fights, not too hot sex, not a deep wisdom of any kind; but a mediocre experience of all of them. What a waste of cast.', '. . . Pocalypse during HOTEL ARTEMIS, and it\'s not a pretty sight. Taking place in 2028, when Mr. T. has followed in mentor Putin\'s footsteps by declaring himself ""President for Life,\' dissolving the Duma or Congress or whatever the ineffectual Capitol Hill Gang was called, and imposing Martial Law in a vain attempt to forestall the rampant looting and rioting taking place in all major U.S. Urban Centers (including Los Angeles, where HOTEL ARTEMIS is set), police shoot-to-kill first, and the only question after is whether to chow down on donuts or Ding Dongs. The make-up department for HOTEL ARTEMIS has done a bang-up job of dolling up the entire cast to look like they have one (or even two!) feet in the grave, to match the natural appearance of Nurse Rancid. However, since you cannot make a silk purse from a trump ear, there\'s really no character in this flick for which you\'d give a tenth of a DEADPOOL. Even the JURASSIC PARK guy looks like he\'s been digested by a HUMAN FLY. While the chick who straddles him for a happy ending seems halfway presentable, and because the plot says that she\'s being paid Big Bucks to perform her tricks on video as Kleenex material, perhaps HOTEL ARTEMIS could have salvaged a rating of ""Seven"" IF she\'d been appropriately undressed for this potentially moving scene. But no such luck.', 'Why wasn\'t this film called Hospital Artemis or John Wicks Healthcare Center? This movie is what happens when the director and the studio can\'t make up theirs minds which genre to copy first; The Purge with its snuff film formula or John Wicks action-without-adventure stylized signature killings. As a hotel it was completely lacking in any semblance of room service but as a grimy, squalid hospital it was precisely the kind of place all the goings on that went on would go on. However it had way too many plots and subplots and twists, and agendas to build around in 96 minutes, and that\'s not counting the riot taking place coincidentally right outside on their doorstep. We waited all day for the predator ""wolf"" to show up and when he did he had the turbidity to not be interesting! At hat point they could have handed me a gun and I would have helped by shooting the writers.', ""I've never wrote a review before but I just had to sign up to IMDB just to write this because it's one of the worst move I've EVER seen. Story was flat, the characters backstory had nothing to do with the main story and it felt like a bunch of people running around like chickens with their heads cut off.There's a review that said ignore the negative reviews? Did you get paid to write that because I watched it for my self and it was the WORST movie I've seen. I come into movies without expectations and even bad movies I can appreciate the effects or screenplay but this movie does nothing right. It's a TOTAL waste of my time."", 'Many have compared HOTEL ARTEMIS to JOHN WICK because of the hotel for criminals, which is just window-dressing here as this dingy palace actually serves as a hospital for injured, high-paying criminal club members, and the plot does sound intriguing but remains a benign foundation for a rushed action-caper just as the hotel itself harbors its crooked clientele...The hardly Noir-ambiguous good-bad people may as well wear endearing, audience-friendly halos, especially Jodie Foster as a boozy do-gooder nurse along with a really cool and mellow black thief who discovers he stole far too much from the wrong people ala CHARLEY VARRICK, combined with a superhuman Kung Fu chick taking down lethal henchman ala KILL BILL, while a broader homage is a complete ""out"" for the suspense: the movie takes place in a familiar dystopic near-future resembling ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK where a riotous mob is tearing up the city because a corporation stole their water i.e. CHINATOWN: All this a contrived attempt to instill a sense of urgency outside since there\'s little to none inside... For example, the Nurse\'s various ER rooms (named after idyllic holiday spots), during what are supposed to be edgy and intense surgeries to mend the badly wounded, are replete with miraculous, robotic, push-button machines that Dr. McCoy from STAR TREK would envy: Leaving an extremely old and haggard-looking, clichÃ©-neurotic, overacting Foster to seem useless and alone even during unexpected peril - although she\'s never actually in real danger thanks to...Dave Bautista, obviously created to ""steal scenes"" as a tough but tender bodyguard named Everest (because he\'s big... like the mountain) while the bad-bad guys include smack-talking weapons-dealer Charlie Day (sounding like Joe Pesci imitating a knee-jerk\'s vision of Donald Trump) and Jeff Goldblum as a powerful crime lord needing emergency-emergency service but, whether these people live or die really doesn\'t matter all that much. The eventual twists, turns and revelations occur within a clunky, patched-together 92-minute run-time: seeming like glimpses of a season-long cable series that\'d require time to grow beyond this dull, misguided, stagey mess that repeats itself over and over, again and again, and hardly even attempts to get off (or even on) the ground-floor.']",/posters/xHotel.jpg

Together they made the original, proper Superfly.The 2018 remake is just as appealing as chewing already chewed gum.', 'I come from the era of Donald Goines books, where I was first introduced to his book named ""Street Players"". Goines book followed the lives of people of African descent living the fast life, making money, partying and enjoying their world their way. SuperFly in my opinion is a reincarnation of Goines book with a 2018 feel to it.The movie follows the life of SuperFly (Trevor Jackson) who is a prominent drug dealer in his home town. He has loyal friends, a great operation, more money than most people will see in a life time, two beautiful women in his life and a great mentor. However, he becomes weary of participating in the drug game and seeks to find a way out, by any means necessary.From the moment I sat down in the theater, and the movie began my eyes were glued to the screen. The actors did a masterful job at playing roles that are common in every day life. SuperFly is the good guy caught up in a life of luxury that he attained illegally. Juju is the jealous one, the hater who represents people who spew hate when they are unhappy seeing others win. Eddie is the loyal best friend to SuperFly who will protect his friend at all costs. Lastly, there is Georgia who is SuperFly\'s ride or die, his love of his life and his inspiration. These characters stood out the most to me because they were true to my lived life experiences.These characters cannot be understood by people who are too privileged to understand the struggle. They will see this movie as difficult to understand , and maybe even a ""waste of time"". However, in all actuality this movie can resonate deeply with all people who try to understand the plot and the characters that are all intertwined in the web of events that occur throughout the movie.This movie will leave a lasting impact on each person who takes the time out to see this film. Pay attention to what\'s occurring in the movie, take your time to analyze each scene and then compare it to your life. Don\'t just focus on the glitz, glamour and gang rivalry. Rather, enthrall yourself in the ideas that the movie is trying to convey. Director X and all those involved did an amazing job with this movie. My 14 dollar ticket was well worth the money.', ""Ok, I don't understand all the hate, I'm a white guy and I liked the movie.

They made it modern and changed the location to ATL. None of that mattered, it was exciting, good story, kept you on edge and had a very satisfying ending. Trevor Jackson was HOT and convincing in his role, it was amazing and I would see it again.', 'The new Superfly movie with Trevor Jackson was good and it had good action and I liked the ending. It stayed true to the original Superfly story done in the 1970s but has some changes here and there - I went and saw it yesterday and was glad I did. Some people are claiming it was not good but I think they just want to be negative and some might even have jealously and is trying to destroy it. It was not perfect, and Trevor Jackson\'s hair could have been ""more permed"" to have that Ron O\'neal look, but it was worth seeing.', '. . . Wakanda, and it\'s right here in the Southeastern USA. That\'s right, SUPERFLY documents a city-state in which ALL the movers and shakers belong to the same ethnic group. Atlanta is depicted as a lawless den of iniquity throughout SUPERFLY, in which normal average Americans are forced into positions of menial servitude, paying through the nose for this ethnic Elite\'s only shown product: cocaine. In cahoots with amoral depraved degenerates from Mexico, Atlanta\'s hedonistic sect spends its days inflicting aimless shootouts and deadly car chase through crosswalks and public parks upon the powerless civilian population, and then passing its nights in wild drug-fueled orgies filled with three-way sex, during which hundred dollar bills permeate the air like so much worthless confetti. Surely SUPERFLY should be all the evidence Leader Trump needs to declare Atlanta\'s ""Sanctuary City"" status null and void, imposing Martial Law and sending tanks rolling through its unholy by-ways just like those deployed to Detroit by LBJ in 1967.', 'I must admit what first attracted me to this movie was all the Atlanta scenes in the trailer. Being from Atlanta that is cool to me. But overall not a bad film of the drug underworld. Once you get in, it is hard to get out. This small time drug dealer wants one big job before he gets out. Unfortunately is it not that easy. Trust is fleeting and everyone seems to be on the take. Cool cars, hot women, and a fast moving players life. Big Boi even plays a convincing Atlanta Mayor.

I saw this at a screening awhile back when it was called STEM (better name in my opinion) and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely recommend.', 'Not only is the action fun but the plot spin made for an interesting scifi movie', ""Upgrade is a mashup of couple different types of movies. It's a revenge-for-hurting-someone-I-love movie, like Taken or The Crow. It's a beware-of-technology movie, like Terminator or any number of 80s sci-fi movies. And it's a super-advanced-robots-might-actually-be-people movie (this one is the most weakly developed part of the movie).  The story takes place roughly 30 years in the future. Grey (the underrated Logan Marshall-Green), restores and sells classic cars. He doesn't adore or attempt to understand the advances in technology as much as most people, especially his wife, who works for one the top tech companies in the world. While riding home in their self-driving car, it malfunctions and crashes in a sketchy neighborhood. Four men assault the couple, killing Grey's wife and damaging his spine in a way that leaves him paralyzed from the neck down. Grey wants desperately to find these men and get his revenge, but he is helpless to do so. Helpless, that is, until a tech genius who previously bought one of his old cars, surgically installs a device (called Stem) into Grey's spine that allows him to walk again. Then he and his now upgraded body proceed to spend the remainder of the movie hunting down the four men who hurt someone he loved.To make things more exciting, the device installed to allow him to walk again can talk to him and occasionally take over his motor functions, making him operate like an advanced robot. This comes in handy since the four men are ruthless criminals who try to kill him. It's a violent and entertaining adventure. Grey is likable character, and Marshall-Green deserves credit because his performance is by the far the strength of the movie. The other characters are weakly developed or not developed at all. Visually, the film works, especially considering the modest budget. It never feels like a cheaply made movie. The filmmakers wisely chose many set pieces that didn't include futuristic tech, so not every shot cost a fortune. Additionally, the action sequences are well-executed. They're fast-paced, shot with smooth camera movement that builds intensity but is careful not to overwhelm or cause viewers to lose track of what is happening. Violence is abundant, yet it doesn't feel excessive. After each violent death, we notice Grey's uncomfortable reaction. He does not have the stomach to commit these violent acts. Stem does the dirty work for him. The movie flows along nicely. The story remains focused, and no scene feels wasted. It all could have, and in my opinion should have, ended in a satisfying successful revenge way. But it doesn't. Instead, it opts for the beware-of-technology movie ending. It attempts to send a message that leaves viewers unsettled rather than comforted. I disagree with the decision. The movie had dark themes and the occasional moment of vicious violence, but it was ultimately a fun movie. Fun movies should not deliver heavy, gloomy endings. In any case, I like the movie and would recommend it to people who like sci-fi. It's a fun ride, even if it fizzles at the finish line."", ""What a great movie. It had all the elements of a real smart action/thriller/sci-fi.The characters journey was perfect in every way. The mood and feel changes were riveting. The action was surprising and awe inspiring at the same time. And the conclusion!

I highly recommend it to anyone who's into action and psychological thrills."", 'It felt like an episode of Black Mirror.

An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn\'t skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at. Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn\'t exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it\'s own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts.

Even if the kid could do it, the chances would be only one in four of getting the batteries oriented correctly. Why didn\'t the creature come back to hunt the father based on the sound of his running footsteps?So it\'s possible to kill the creatures with a gun? Okay, then ... with gun ownership in the US being about one per capita, surely the creatures would have been wiped out long ago by having provided the population with the target practice they must secretly crave?So a family with kids survived whatever (unexplained) apocalypse occurred prior to the film\'s beginning, but the army didn\'t?So the creatures have no vision and super-sensitive hearing? What about a sense of smell?So no one talks in their sleep or snores (or has farts)? Do toilets flush?So the creatures can rip though a metal grain silo, but not instantly get into a truck to get at the two kids inside? And out of interest, how do you harvest a field of corn without making a sound? How do you remove the kernels of corn from the cobs and get them into the silo?So they have to play Monopoly with crocheted pieces (to avoid noise), but the sound of a truck rolling down a hillside is okay?I think that would be shortest labour in history.

Just for the benefit of herself and all around her? Clearly the dangers have not been made clear.\n7. Why does dad and son go for food so close to her having the baby? You would think he would have been prepared so as not to have to be gone during this time. Clearly the dangers around them are not clear.\n8. Why are they sealing the entrance underground with a mattress? This is the best you have? With all the other stuff they have done around there I would have expected them to be underground more.

They have electricity. And why do you let kids sit that close to a lantern on the floor? Clearly the dangers around them have not been made clear.\n11. Why show all the other people lighting their signal fires just to not mention them in any other scene for any reason at all? \n12. Why was the scene with the old man so stupid?\n13. Why show that creepy old house if not including any other scenes explaining it?\n14. Why was the top of the babies crib off? How did that happen?\n15.

Other reviews give a good overview of the plot, I'm not looking to do that here. I just want to point out some plot inconsistencies and/or the lack of critical thinking that the characters demonstrate. I will list a few of my observations below. 1. They go to a waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monsters can't hear them. Why not live there? They could fish and collect drinking water near the river. The monsters would probably stay away from the area since the sound of the falls would impede their hunting ability. 2. When taking a walk, does anyone seriously let the youngest child of the group walk behind them. Why on earth would they let a young boy walk a hundred yards behind the adults in such a dangerous situation. They can't even correct the boy if he makes any mistakes, and indeed this results in his death. 3. How on earth did they get the corn planted? By hand? After 400+ days you wouldn't see corn in nice little neat rows like it was planted by farm equipment. 4. Since the monsters can't hear you if there is a loud sound nearby, why not bring out one of the downstairs speakers and blast something 24/7 on one of the nearby trees or on top of the house? The monsters would get used to the sound and leave the area alone, leaving the family to talk in peace. 5. What human with a brain wouldn't consider making a soundproof room. They could go to the city, get a bunch of foam, blankets, pillows, whatever, and plaster it around one of the larger rooms until they created an effective sound barrier. In the movie, a single mattress pulled over a walkway is an effective sound shield. Imagine how effective they could be if they put some ACTUAL effort into soundproofing the room. 6. Apparently the monsters can be killed by shotguns? The entire military was wiped out, with all the weaponry of the finest military in the world rendered useless against the monsters, but Emily Blunt shoots one in the head and kills it? Right. 7. The mother, Emily Blunt, is pregnant. Why would you bring a newborn child into this world, when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family. You know that babies cry right? Pull out or use a condom. 8. If the monsters can hear the faintest sound from far way, why do they have trouble hearing sounds that even humans can decipher at close range. A baby crying, a mother's heavy breathing, a persons heartbeat. All of these things would be loud to a creature that hear can hear footstep from a half mile away. 9. The mother's water breaks and she starts having the baby. She tries to contain her gasps and walks downstairs only to step on a nail on the stairway. She lets out a sound and falls, causing the monsters to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child. However, just in time, she is saved by fireworks designed to distract the monsters. Instead of removing the nail like any sane person, they just ignore it and leave it sticking up on the stairs for someone else to step on. Dumb. This movie isn't terrible, with great acting and a pretty unique backstory. But the glaring logical fallacies and the idiocracy of the characters made the movie completely unwatchable for me. The monsters don't really seem that formidable after further inspection, and if the family followed any of the tips I mention, they could live with little difficulty."", ""I also can't understand the fuzz about this absurd movie.

Everything so dumb and stupid. Not worth it."", 'Praise from the critics, 8.0 on IMDb, did I watch the right movie?A Quiet Place is one of the dumbest and most boring flicks I have ever seen. For a movie that positions itself as a horror title it has zero suspense and scary moments. The only scary thing about is is how people seem to praise it despite it being unoriginal dull garbage.With the premise being ""humans are hunted by blind monsters that react to loud noises"", this basically becomes ""Screamer, the movie"", as this is the only trick that Krasinski offers - everything is silent, and sharp noises occur occasionally.There is no plot in a Quiet Place. A moronic family just goes about their business and cannot muster some sort of a sound-proof room to be able to talk in, instead they use the sign language and go to a waterfall to scream. Yeah, I didn\'t make that up, the writers did. They do have a basement which they cover with a mattress and it seems to help, but for whatever reason they don\'t do it regularly. Also, in the beginning act the parents lose their youngest child whom they failed to teach properly that if he makes sounds he will die. What do they do after his death? Well they go ahead and make a new one! And then they put the baby in a coffin to muffle its cooing!What else is there? Shots of naked feet occur with suspicious frequency. The mute plump girl needs 3 separate occasions to understand that her hearing aid drives the monsters back. The film lasts an hour and a half, but most of the scenes are either too long or unnecessary at all. (Like with the old man in the woods.) The family survives for around a year, yet the father still can\'t properly hunt fish, he just grabs it with bare hands and it slips away, genius. The monsters are described as ""indestructible"" in the newspapers, yet they die from a single shotgun headshot.Apparently this is John Krasinski\'s directorial debut. Well, at least he shouldn\'t have trouble improving on himself later with the bar set so low.', ""Don't believe the hype on this movie. This is an example of extremely lazy script writing. I'm kind of shocked that so many people are saying this movie was great. I saw Chris Pratt on Instagram raving about this movie and urging his followers to go see it. As I sat in the theater, I was so distracted by the constant glaring plot holes that I found the movie extremely frustrating and boring. If you are paying attention to the movie as you watch it, you will find it impossible to take serious. SPOILERS AHEAD! \nThe monsters key on sound, right? But we learn about halfway through the movie that there is a nearby waterfall, the sound of which is sufficient to mask the sounds that the monsters would normally key on. Uh, so, why not just move the family right next to the waterfall (where is also where they fish for food) and just camp out there? Pretty stupid. OK, next, the dad has the farm rigged with tons of lights. Just, lights strung up all over the fields. Where does he get the electricity for all those lights? Not to mention his little technology lab down in the basement. No generator? Is there a generator? If there is, how does he keep it fueled and how does he keep it from making noise? The monsters can be easily fooled with a kitchen timer, right? So, seems to me that it would be pretty easy to set traps for these things. Or, at the very least, how about rigging up noise makers? You know, you could power them with the apparently endless electricity they have? I could go on and on, but lets talk about the nail scene. I found this particularly frustrating. The nail is nailed DOWN in to the step, but the HEAD of the nail gets caught on Emily Blunt's laundry bag, and gets pulled up. The makes sense. But then, suddenly, the SHARP end of the nail is pointing UP. That makes no sense. Nails are not pounded UP in to the steps. The head of the nail would be up, which would probably hurt if you stepped on it in your bare feet, but it would penetrate. That nail scenario made absolutely no sense whatsoever. These and many other glaring plot holes made this movie impossible to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest problem of course is the very essence of the title: they are in a world where it is essential to make no noise, so, despite having two healthy children to look after, they decide to have a baby. Pretty much the only things babies do is poop and make noise. So their plan is to put it in a sound proof box? For how long? The next 4 years of it's miserable life? That's their plan???This movie was just stupid. I hated it. It is nothing but bad, lazy writing with setups and scenarios that do not make sense and do not make sense. Save yourself from this movie. Don't believe the hype. Don't bother. Read my review and know that this movie sucks."", 'I always read imdb reviews and others before I go to a movie. I read about 20 reviews and everyone praised this movie as one of the best horror movies in a long time, it also had an 8.2 rating. Even though I was skeptical I decided to see it with my wife. So after sitting thru it for about 45 min. I was still waiting for this movie to ""ramp up"" as so many said it would. Well I guess all the reviews were done by people associated with the movie as the only reason it put me on the ""edge of my seat"" was because we were debating whether to leave or not. We didn\'t leave but we should have. This was about as pathetic a movie as you can get, horror or otherwise. Standard monsters that have been done many times before. Few if any scares. And the payoff, They figured out how to neutralize the monsters. Save your money, see something else, anything else! Believe me I\'m not particularly picky when it comes to movies, I just want to be entertained and the Quiet place fell way way short of doing that.', ""Brilliant idea. I had very high hopes for this movie. The more I watched it, the quicker I realized that I (and the three other patrons in the theater) had been duped. I'm not going to beat this movie to death by going into details... everyone else has already done that. The movie came with a message: women and girls are smart and brave and men and boys are short-sighted (stupid), cowardly, and bumbling idiots. Case in point: the father had in his possession a shotgun which (as we learn late in the movie) was perfectly capable of killing the monsters. Why he had never attempted this, we'll never know. Why the military wasn't brought in, we'll also never know. I agree with everyone else about stupidity of bringing a baby into such a world, especially knowing that it would be impossible to defend him against such a murderous creature, while also endangering the health of the mother during the birth of the baby. I also couldn't get past the young boy who essentially grew up in this silent, dangerous world but acts like he was just dropped in from a happier time and place. And the nail... stair treads get hammered down from above, not up from underneath! Unbelievable. Equally unbelievable are some of these reviews. Totally fake. They all read very similar. Pretty sad."", ""Spoiler alert...Don't read before watching... Or read if not planning to watch... I'd recommend the second option...The family knows that higher sound levels will hide the lower sounds... And the father actually showed the son how they can yell and shout beside a waterfall...\nAny sane group of people would immediately think... Hey... What a wonderful place to live at... We can talk and do normal things as long as the waterfall sound can mask it...The father has a whole range of electronics and showed he knows how to make them work...\nMaybe it's just me... But I'd have my fun with the aliens by hooking up a hundred speakers all over the place on top of trees and under rocks etc... and then sit on the silo making each one make a sound alternately... By making some sound on one, then a minute later sound another a few miles away and on and on...the entertainment would be watching the aliens rush to one and then to the other until they run themselves dizzy...\nWhen the entertainment is over... They can all go back to their waterfall home and laugh themselves silly...If the movie followed this plan... It'd be done in 20 minutes... Assuming the first 15 minutes are needed to set up the story... And even we can only handle watching aliens run around in circles for no more than 2-3 minutes... The last 2 minutes are the family back at their waterfall laughing and joshing about the day's entertainment and eating as loudly as they please...So there... Was going to give this movie a zero...

Not so much...)"", ""Out for a nice romantic evening with my wife and we checked on here for the ratings.... 8/10 you say ! So we went for a couple of cheeky drinks then off to the pictures for the 9:10 showing. All was going well until the film started and about 5 minutes in I was losing the will to live. After I realised that if you made a noise this thing would come and eat you I was very tempted to scream hoping the thing would jump out of the screen and put me out of my misery. I'm not sure who rates on here but come on ... 8/10."", ""From early on in this movie, we see a board full of notes and newspaper clippings detailing the situation. There's a group of aliens who hunt based on sound. What we don't know is what's their weakness. Are we going to to learn anything about the challenges of fighting these things? Nope. What does their weakness turn out to be? As it turned out, they are vulnerable to a point blank shotgun blast to the face. Who'd of thought? \nBut you don't want to make any noise though, because that will attract them all, right? Well, if it's a shotgun, yes. If it's fireworks, no, not so much. Other than that, the aliens are out of central casting, the story was rushed and there were several plot holes. Not worth the hype."", 'I am Deaf. I realllllly enjoy it!! So it good for people who know sign Langurge and deaf. For deaf people have to watch that movie!!! So action and drama!!!', ""I honestly have no idea how this movie reviewed so well, as I was sitting there I was absolutely dumbfounded by the actions of the characters and how these 'aliens' could even beat an organised human army of the middle ages. They wouldn't even need swords, I reckon they could have gotten the job done with sticks and rocks. We are seriously meant to believe that aliens, with seemingly no sense of site or smell but incredibly hyperacuity of sound, beat humans? That is the first and primary stupid premise of this film. Sound is the easiest thing to manipulate, can be matched with opposing noise to cover and as we found out later they have an intensely disabling reaction to high pitched sound. SERIOUSLY? If we met creatures like that on an opposing planet, we would make them extinct. Set up a sound box, bring them in blow them up/shoot them when they get near. Put DOG WHISTLES on humans to disable them when routing the few stragglers, have loud speakers on an armoured vehicle whilst patrolling so they would attack that and the men could walk up close, change the pitch to very high and place his gun on its head for an easy kill. I mean honestly, the most manipulable sensation is the only one they have? And to add insult to injury, a shotgun blast clearly blows it's head open (so their armour or not so tough) and they emit electromagnetic pulses when getting near? There is no believable scenario in which these things would triumph over humans. I thought maybe these creatures had sonar capability, but no they are even more useless than bats.Secondly, the humans in this are so utterly stupid its not funny. So the backup plan to scatter the aliens away if they are on the farm..... light 5- fireworks to distract them for about 20 seconds. Something much easier- a remote speaker activated with an ipod? A FREAKING RADIO with remote switch? They have power in this film, yet this is the best thing they can think of?His death was contrived nonsense too. The only thing he could think of was to scream to draw the alien away from his kid? How about throwing rocks/the pick he was holding AT THE GIANT METAL SHED BESIDE HIM? Also, WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING BUT GO TO AN OPEN FIELD WHEN THE CREATURES ARE CLOSE? You have a distinct advantage in site- running to a closed car COMPLETELY DISABLES this. Common sense would dictate when you think its close, crouch down, breath into your sleeve to reduce sound and keep eyes open. The alien will neither smell nor see you, and if you need to move that you can see it and go slowly, whilst trying to throw an object somewhere to make noise for a distraction. She is heavily pregnant and they build a soundproof room that's NOT EVEN SEALED properly. They have a mattress that goes over the trap door? Ultra dumb and tries to set tension later in the film. It just screams laziness when a horror film has to build tension through dumb and pretentious means that no human would ever do.I could go on and on. This film is terribly lazy in building drama, uses jump scares all the time, cliched in the family 'unit' (there are seriously people here talking about the great dialogue??? This film had decisively little dialogue in it, and was utterly vanilla. They were all stereotypical family members, I bet not one person can name a quirk or unique character trait of any of them). The humans are stupid and the aliens are an incredibly flawed invader- Arnold from Predator could make a whole bunch of traps in the trees like he did in that film and wipe them all out in an afternoon. Overall, one of the worst movies I have seen in a while."", ""So many questions and so many illogical and nonsensical things in this movie. \nIf the sound is so important and if the batteries for the toy are so important, why leave the batteries on a table next to the toy and leave the room, dear GOD!!!

Why if you can talk and live normal at the waterfall and lake are you inland at your house? You mean to tell me that the entire world is wiped out and nobody thought to themselves let's crank up the volume on radio waves? Dumb movie."", ""The premise is that if you make a sound, monsters will get you. I am fine with a film creating whatever rules or framework it wants. You want a film with Magic, fine. Supernatural powers, fine. Or a film where If any sound is made, the monsters attack in seconds and make lighting quick work of their prey, fine. There is a lot I like about the film, but when you routinely break the very rules you create, the movie becomes frustrating and unenjoyable. In this film the creators establish that sounds of a beeping space shuttle toy bring monsters in under 10 seconds. And they kill the living thing holding the toy so fast you barely see it. That's fast. Also, the sound of a falling silo door brings a monster, also in a very fast time. A scream will bring a monster in a matter of seconds. And kill you just as fast. Normal talking will also bring a monster so you must use sign language. Also, the sound of a raccoon just making normal night time noises will bring a monster to kill the raccoon. So, how is it the loud sound of the same raccoon falling on the roof one minute before not bring the monster? How is it that the same raccoon, a full raccoon size, did not get killed every single day before the scene shown? Is he using raccoon sign language and forgot that night? \nThe silo door falling brings the monster but the roof noise from the raccoon does not? The roof noise was louder and the monster was clearly in the area because the monster killed the raccoon a moment later. How is they show birds in the sky making noises early in the film, but no monster attack? Do the birds only make noise when flying? Do they ever nest? Of course they must land. Do they always stay quiet when they nest or land? How did the creatures not attack then? Birds are noisy but they survive. They monsters can easily and swiftly get to the top of a silo, why not a tree? They can cut through a silo wall, so why not a tree or whatever the birds are in?\nThey establish that non-living things making noise bring the monster. The afore mentioned door, and also a gun, fireworks, etc. also, there is an object that falls that nearly hits the ground and the family shows their collective relief when it is caught before hitting the ground. Obviously, they are afraid a falling object will bring the monster. But, a river or waterfall does not bring the monster. Maybe they attacked the river and gave up? If so, why not live a bit closer to the water. The rustling of leaves of a tree or corn stalks does not bring the monster, apparently? Leaves are alive. Why do they ignore that? The family can't make a creaking sound in the house because it will bring a monster, so they walk around barefoot. But, anyone who has lived in a home knows that homes make a random, creaking sound on their own from time to time. What happens then?. And the wind would make sounds against the house frequently. Of course, they have to live in a house with wood floors and no carpets or rugs to help muffle any sound, but take serious care to make the paths outside sound resistant to their feet. Also, did no one cough during the last year? Does no one snore? What about flatulance? Surely someone must have had a good sneeze. These sounds are louder than a whisper and often louder than normal talking. Yet, they avoided the monster for over a year. And, why do they have to keep reminding people to be quiet by putting their finger over their mouths? You'd think after a year the people alive would have figured that one out. Why do monsters ignore the creaking, rusted swing during the walk home with the dad and son? Because a creaking, rusted swing sounds erie and adds to tension? They also ignore the newspaper blowing in the wind at the beginning of the film, because why again? Is it Becasue a newspaper blowing in the wind sets a mood? The monsters move incredibly fast, faster than any animal, but then move as slow as a sloth, painfully slow, when moving against the people the director does not want killed. There are so many ways this movie could have been better. The concept is not bad, but the execution is frustrating. It's not a bad movie, and I enjoyed parts, but you must turn off your brain and ignore facts to give this anything more than a mild recommendation. I liked the actors and thought they did well with the material. I liked the family concept. You felt like everyone mattered and no one was expendable, except the old dude of course. There are plenty of other things buggy about the movie but the lack of consistency is what really bothered me. I wanted the film to succeed and I found myself trying to make excuses for the story, making assumptions to try and explain how the story could work and be believable, but the inconsistencies were too much.

Why I ask myself would anyone get pregnant and produce a screaming baby, when you know certain death awaits you ? Really ?

John Krasinski, most famous for playing the role of Jim Halpert in The Office, brings us a new horror in the form of A Quiet Place, and the result is one of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.Evelyn and Lee Abbott (played by real life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski) live with their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), on a farm. They live every day in silence to survive the threat of creatures that hunt by sound.The simplicity of the concept makes A Quiet Place such a fascinating prospect but it's the execution that excels it to soaring heights. Krasinski has crafted a horror film that grabs you in a vice-like grip from the very first shot, not letting go until the end credits start to roll, honing in perfectly on the use of sound and silence for some of the most intense sequences in recent memory.The fear factor in A Quiet Place comes from the tension and suspense Krasinski develops throughout, a true standout sequence being when a heavily pregnant Evelyn finds herself evading a creature as she goes into labour. It's moments like this one that had me gripping the arms of my seat and holding my breath numerous times throughout. Coming to the performances, A Quiet Place possesses the rarest of the rare in horror films with a cast who all deliver great performances. Parents should always be protective of their children but the situation they find themselves in here adds another layer to that and Blunt and Krasinski excel in showing the desperation they face to keep their children safe. Child actors always make me feel a little cautious going into a film however, both are very good here, Simmonds in particular. As a deaf actress, Simmonds adds an authenticity to proceedings and her performance is one not to be overlooked.There were a few scenes I wish Krasinski had elaborated on more but those are just a few minor issues I had that can take a back seat to the ingenuity shown in the crafting of a horror film that has the makings of a classic. It's worth noting that the entire audience was in total silence throughout, a sign that this film is well and truly having the desired effect."", 'I loved the tension, the aliens, the whole premise of sound.

I also want to begrudgingly nod to JLaw for putting so much effort into this terrible role. Her acting is awful but she does try so hard and I genuinely feel sorry for her after seeing this. The film loses 8 stars, and I walked out, for the following laundry list of reasons:The characters are mostly cringey one dimensional stereotypes, who don\'t develop. All they care to convey is that Russia is evil, America is great. Every Russian man is the devil. Ugh. We get it. \nThe plot is a loose, waffling mess filled with either pointless scenarios, ridiculous scenarios or long drawn out useless scenes. Not sure why others are claiming there was tension or suspense, because there really wasn\'t any. Don\'t worry, I ""got it"". But it just wasn\'t worth getting. \nThe atmosphere is stale, clunky, and stilted. It never draws you in. Others have noted the film feels empty. \nThe dialogue is lower grade than the worst tv soap opera.\nThe accents are a joke. \nIt lacks any semblance of class or intelligence.\nIt is trying so hard to be sexy and edgy and but it\'s actually just so boring. People were legit falling asleep in the theatre.\nWhen people weren\'t falling asleep they were covering their eyes to escape the unnecessarily gruesome and jarring scenes of rape, rape again, gory violence, torture, more torture, Flashdance posed torture, skin peeling, etc etc etc. I can handle sex and violence but as others have said, this felt like a torture porn or a snuff film. It was very poorly done. \nThe direction and acting is flat out terrible. There is no excuse in 2018 when people should know what constitutes a good film.\nJLaw doesn\'t change facial expression. She is appallingly bad in this. Appallling. \nThere are heaps of mistakes that are very annoying, like the floppy disks and the hair dye. \nThe list goes on....This film is a blight on the industry, frankly. It is also an insult to women, an insult to sex, an insult to all movies, an insult to the spy/thriller genre, and an insult to all viewers. I\'m not going to pay money to be insulted, so I walked out. Oh and did I mention that half the theatre walked out? It wasn\'t just me! Yes, this movie really is THAT awful. You have been warned. If you really want to see this for some reason, my advice is to save your money and wait a few years for when it\'s on television.', ""Ballerina Dominika Egorova is recruited to 'Sparrow School,' a Russian intelligence service where she is forced to use her body as a weapon.

Now, firstly, I have not seen the original, but as a big fan of Eli Roth\'s horror movies, I had to watch it and I have to say, it\'s very well executed by Master of Horror, Eli Roth. It\'s a violent revenge action movie. It\'s no ordinary direct-to-video movie or overrated Hollywood movie. Most importantly, it\'s a movie that finally stars Bruce Willis as the main man, bringing back the action in the old school way. It also stars great actors such as Vincent D\'Onofrio and Elisabeth Shue. It\'s definitely awesome to see a Hollywood legend kicking ass, the old school way, on the big screen. It\'s all thanks to Eli Roth, and God bless him for bringing back Bruce Willis.', 'My kids made me go see this movie, and after watching it I was glad they did. The story different enough to make this one seem very ""now"", so comparing this movie to the 1974 original is really not fair to either movie. Bruce Willis is good, Elisabeth Shue is good, the detectives are good. The movie doesn\'t run long, is paced well and I liked the action. Movies are supposed to entertain and this one is entertaining.I remember seeing the original Death Wish in a drive-in. It was good, too. I hope they do a sequel for this one.', 'You can read the plot details on the other reviews, and you\'ve probably seen the earlier version with Bronson.Did you enjoy the original ""Death Wish?"" Did you enjoy ""Die Hard?"" Do you like Bruce Willis in general?Got at least one out of three? Go see this.In a word: WOW.', 'America has been starving for a truly entertaining film with no political baggage, and Death Wish delivers. It doesnt incriminate the viewer for owning a weapon with which to defend themselves, which sets it apart from most movies today. Perhaps excessively gory at times, it still manages to tell a meaningful story, and executes (pardon the pun) the theme cleverly.', ""Without giving too much away I feel I need to give a quick synopsis of the movie. Dr. Paul Kersey is an ER surgeon in Chicago, who while at work, was confronted with the news that his wife was murdered during a home invasion and his daughter was in critical condition. Kersey, wrought with the fact that he couldn't protect his family, then acquires a Glock 17 and kills a few criminals on the streets, perhaps to cope with his guilt, or perhaps since the cops failed at keeping the streets safe. Gratuitous violence ensues. Bruce Willis, played the antihero Dr. Paul Kersey in such a fresh way, deviating from his tried and true action hero roles. His performance of Kersey learning the news that his wife was dead was heart wrenching. He didn't display the traditional hysterical sobbing and then rage at the ones responsible, but rather exuded a quiet sadness that was so profound it felt more genuine and believable.I love how Eli Roth directed Death Wish. The movie had great pacing, it was full of memorable dialog, it had the right amount of gore and revenge. My only disappointment is that the end of the movie neatly wrapped everything up so there was no hint at a sequel or franchise.Some reviewers are getting too political about this movie. Saying we are all gun-crazy people in the US who don't believe in the justice system and want vigilante justice. It's just a movie people..."", 'Great to see a movie that can entertain and not drown the audience with political correctness....', 'Death Wish (2018) opens with a montage that feels like some sort of PSA advocating gun control, which seems frightfully incongruous in the remake of a film about vigilantism, especially when a character ultimately relies on a fully-automatic BDR-15 3G assault rifle to defend his home and family. This is one of many incongruities in a film that seems torn between the demands of the action genre and the social imperative to present a progressive, liberal political message. Action films tend to fall to the right of the political spectrum, featuring such elements as clandestine operations without public oversight, extrajudicial executions, sophisticated clandestine surveillance, enhanced interrogations, vigilantism, private ownership of firearms, concealed weapons and criminal profiling. This doesn\'t preclude presenting different perspectives, as was done effectively in Lions for Lambs (2007), Spy Game (2001) or Lone Star (1996). Nor does it preclude a cautionary message, as in Secret in Their Eyes (2015) or Eye in the Sky (2015). However, presenting dissenting viewpoints needs to be done more skillfully than is evident here. The inciting incident in Death Wish (1974), starring Charles Bronson, was the brutal onscreen gang rape of his wife and daughter. The audience was appalled and instantly sympathetic with Bronson\'s Paul Kersey. But a scene of sexual abuse might not sit well with audiences in the #MeToo era. So, the filmmakers empower the two women. First, they spend a full ninety seconds establishing that the daughter has been accepted into a top university, then show that she\'s an athlete and proficient in the Krav Maga fighting system. We also learn that the mother is about to earn her Ph.D. The inciting incident doesn\'t occur until about fifteen minutes into the film and doesn\'t make much sense. We\'re expecting a truly horrendous act that will push Bruce Willis\'s Dr Kersey, a man dedicated to compassion and saving lives, over the edge. The setup is actually fairly clever. A group of burglars learn that an upscale home will be vacant at a particular time and wait for the family to leave. But something happens to disrupt the family\'s plans and Dr Kersey departs, leaving his wife and daughter alone. Rather than scrubbing their plan, the burglars wait. Eventually, the wife and daughter also leave and the burglars enter. But, rather than staying out all evening, the ladies return after a brief errand to find three armed burglars hiding in the shadows wearing masks. Why are they wearing masks to burglarize an empty home? Maybe they\'re afraid this family with no children has a nanny cam. And why carry a firearm, which would subject them to much more severe penalties if captured? One of the burglars decides he wants to sexually assault the daughter. Exactly what he has in mind is never clear. But another tells him, ""We don\'t have time for this!"" Who is it exactly that doesn\'t have time? The three burglars have been waiting in their van for perhaps an hour or so, and continued to wait after Dr Kersey left. Another burglar just told the wife that she would save them twenty minutes by opening the safe, so they\'re running ahead of schedule. We later learn the items they stole are still at their fence\'s a couple of weeks later. The audience has sat through a quarter of hour of exposition on gun control and female empowerment, waiting for the gratuitous sex and violence they came to see. The victim isn\'t going anywhere. Everybody seems to have nothing but time on their hands. One wonders if the dialogue actually expresses the angst and frustration of the screenwriter and/or director, compelled by societal pressures to incorporate incongruous political messages which slow the pace and weaken dramatic impact. In any event, the scene fizzles rather than shocks. Rather than executing a brilliant Krav Maga maneuver, the daughter slashes one of the assailants with a novelty knife, which, unlike most novelty knives, is razor sharp. The burglars don\'t brutally gang-rape the daughter, which would make Dr Kersey\'s motives seem more credible and give the actress\'s later scenes greater poignancy. Instead, Dr Kersey is motivated almost entirely by the effects of gun violence, which he already sees every day as a trauma surgeon. Death Wish often feels as if it is distracted by trying to deliver political messages. Detective Raines (Dean Norris) has a partner, played by Kimberly Elise, who doesn\'t do much or say anything that Raines couldn\'t say, but stands around looking diverse and inclusive. DW could have taken any of various directions. Dr Kersey\'s quest for vengeance could have taken him deeper and deeper into the criminal underbelly of society. His acts of violence could have profoundly impacted his view of society and his medical practice. They could have drawn an allegory between his acts and the gang members who resort to violence when unable to seek justice when somebody steals their drugs or infringes on their turf. A copycat vigilante is killed and Dr Kersey\'s actions are the topic of running commentary by talk show hosts, but no profound insights are offered. Dr Kersey seems largely reactive, rather than proactively driving the action. A putatively untraceable pistol which is seemingly not linked to any other crimes literally falls into his hands, as do various clues as to the identities of the burglars. Much of the plot relies on similar coincidences, making it seem contrived. We\'re left with a ponderous and tepid action film that devotes more effort to not ruffling feathers than building complex multifaceted characters with believable motives.', 'Badly written, poorly acted and zero continuity. Avoid.', 'I am not an expert reviewer but after seeing all the 10/10 reviews, which I can only assume, are by millennials who are used to watching YouTube clips, I just had to write something to kind of give balance to the nonsense. I have read comments about the ""depth"" and ""charter (I assume they were trying for character) development"" There is NONE! Also phrases such as ""It\'s a throwback to the 80s"" obviously from someone who wasn\'t born in the 80s! This is total rubbish played out by Willis who knows (oh he knows) that his days of being The action hero are long gone. I\'m not one of those ""Well I really love Eli Roth"" people. Neither am I a wing (left or right) or part of some anti gun group, before I\'m judged to be, just someone who is a bit discerning when it comes to what I will spend 1 hour and 45 minutes watching. If a movie is good, then it\'s good. If a movie is a big steamy pile, then it\'s not! This is the latter! In the first 6 minutes there is a character at the daughters football (soccer) game, who looks like someone from a hidden camera gameshow, who is blatantly trying to get a reaction, First you see him standing there fidgeting, looking all around and then he starts with the obscenities and the threats. Straight from there to a restaurant for celebratory meal with daughter and guess what? Yep, the dodgy valet! Skip to where the Wife is dead in hospital and the scene is acted as though a bike had been stolen from his front driveway, absolutely no real anger, grief, nothing! It goes on from one stupid scene to the next. Seriously this generation of movie makers lack imagination when it comes to making original movies and instead seem intent on re making everything that was good in the day so they can make money from people who cannot tell good from bad.', ""A remake of Michael Winner's Death Wish, that in itself is kind of depressing. How can the filmmakers be so unaware of the times we're living in or maybe they are not, unaware. If they know what they're doing then it's just unforgivable.

When i first saw the trailer for 'Death Wish' i thought that it was going to be a decent enough remake but the film was nothing like i expected i mean the best parts of the movie are in the trailers. Bruce Willis tries hard to pass as a vigilante when on the same time he can't even cry properly, Dean Norris is a generic fat cop who eats a little candy and spits it and Vincent D'Onofrio wasn't even needed to be honest. Elisabeth Shue and Camila Morrone were the best parts of the film as a whole and the first 20 to 24 minutes were decent but then it went downhill with Willis learning how to become a badass from videos and the ending was so over the top.

Serious inaccuracies related to gun ownership in Chicago that seem politically motivated. It is one of the ""great"" GUN FREE ZONES in America where the laws are the strictest in our Country, yet where a majority of firearm violence and murders takes place. Nice try Hollywood.', ""First off, ignore all of the so called professional critics who have been slamming this film with overly negative reviews, simply due to petty politics. They are no better than the vile individuals that planned to flood Black Panther with negative ratings. It is a violent, action-thriller, so it is what it is. If you enjoy the genre, you'll likely enjoy this film.It's not the greatest movie ever, but it is far the splatty/rotten ratings it has received."", 'In 1974, ""Death Wish"" starred Charles Bronson. This new version starred Bruce Willis. They both played Paul Kersey. Bronson\'s Kersey was an architect in New York. Willis\'s version is a doctor. Bronson handled a gun well. Willis can handle a gun well, but his Paul Kersey version couldn\'t handle a Glock during the first encounter with the car jackers. Kersey(Willis) suffered a ""slide bite"" when he fired the Glock. Since this Paul Kersey is a doctor, he has no trouble patching up his wounds. And when he helped the black victims, they would see him as a hero. The car jacking victims and the kid who was shot by the ""ice cream man"". Though there were split thoughts about vigilante attacks, Kersey was avenging his family. So when his daughter came out of her coma, he stayed closer to her. \nBoth versions of ""Death Wish"" were kind of the same. Only this one is updated. And it had some humor to it. The death scenes are little more gruesome than the Bronson version. I liked it very much. \nBoth versions of the movie deserve a 2 Thumbs Up!!\nBoth deserve 5 Stars!!!', 'Just watched this in the theater, we had so much fun. We all cheered for Paul Kersey to whoop some butt. Bruce Willis definetly has some cowboy credit with Die Hard under his belt. I had some very familiar feelings in some scenes in this deathwish. ""hes baaaack!"" Eli Roth has done it AGAIN! This movie hits home with a lot of people. We all ride the bus, the subway, trains, we see the underside of the city most people dont dare to go. True life, nobody is safe. And instead of run down NY of the 70\'s which was literally a warzone, we get to see modern day Chicago. It was brilliant. So just like in Bronson\'s classic, the ""Grim Reaper"" (as the Chicago radio call him) gets revenge on the people that were involved and responsible in his wifes death and daughter in a coma. He also just stops crimes in the making, and in one scene goes to a neighborhood because the drug dealer shoots an innocent kid. I felt this movie wasen\'t about black or white, or guns or no guns. But about whats right and whats wrong. Everybody can get behind that, we need more movies like this. We also get to see some brutal death scenes, the theater gasped at almost everyone. Do you have any idea how hard that is to do nowadays? 10 stars, a great crime thriller without too much over the top gunplay and fantastic acting. Vincent D\'Onofrio is great in this, such a genuine person. My GF enjoyed this movie too, and she normally hates everything. I was shocked. Cant wait for the Blu Ray or 4K release of this.', 'Well done. This remake has accomplished what many others don\'t. It feels fresh and despite knowing the general plot it kept me on the edge of my seat. Also sooo good to see a movie that has not been destroyed by too much Hollywood PC. Clear, true logic is allowed as in ""the police arrive after the crime"" and ""if you want to protect yourself or your family you got to do it"". Two thumbs up.']",/posters/xDeath.jpg

I am out now and my life has been different ever since. Better ever since. I did not lose a single friend when I came out. I gained a new family of friends. I encourage anyone younger, or older, that is not out to do so. BUT, only when you are ready. You'll know when the time is right. This might just be one of the most important movies of the year.

You deserve it."", 'Part of me really wants to scream from the rooftops that the world is right in loving this movie. But I\'m holding that back to talk about how the film is, as a film. It\'s not worth giving every movie with a positive message and cute moments a 10/10. Film doesn\'t work like that. By this logic Geostorm is a godsend of a movie. And we all know how that went.Let\'s go with the good. I think that yes, this movie is quite cute. Most of the dialogue is pretty great. Even the emotional moments toward the end are pretty good. The actors have a lot to work with, and aside from some moments that don\'t work, they try a good amount. It\'s interesting to see how the world is fairly similar to the real world, with believable dialogue and predictable teenage behavior.I think the message of the movie is nice. Being gay is totally fine, and seeing this kid grow throughout the course of the movie is fitting. He\'s just an average guy, a little shy, and gay, but hasn\'t told anyone yet. So he just goes through life, staying with his friends, being himself. There\'s some good moments in here that fit, and the coming out scenes are handled very well. The ending is extremely adorable as well. I won\'t say anything specific, but bring tissues if you are not strong willed.That being said, despite how I like the acting, the dialogue, and the message... I think this movie has a lot of horrible cliche stuff that just doesn\'t work at all. The leads are romantically involved, but they aren\'t gonna say anything about it. The kids all hang out in Drama class. The one guy threatens to leak information if he doesn\'t get the girl with the help of the lead. Does it sound like I\'m describing Love, Simon? Or am I describing every high school rom-com you\'ve ever seen? Really the only twist here is the lead is gay and it seems the rest aren\'t. I dunno, halfway through it felt like the girl who secretly liked Simon was actually gay too.The bully characters- they\'re not even characters. They have maybe 5 lines. And they\'re only there to be the ""homophobic anchors"" and pull off one really obnoxious scene where the kind and understanding Drama teacher (of course it was the Drama teacher) roasts them in front of the whole school. They\'re not even offensive, if I saw ""bullies"" like that at my school I\'d just laugh at them, not with them. They get roasted every time they make an offensive joke anyways. You could literally take them out and *nothing* would change. It\'s just another cliche that doesn\'t need to be there.The ""antagonist"" is really really dumb. He just accidentally stumbles across Simon\'s conversations and uses it as blackmail. He does realize that being gay is a touchy subject right? He has no real consideration, doesn\'t even hesitate when blackmailing. The movie treats him as pure evil with one goal: to get someone to like him. A special someone... could this get any cheesier? I think if I sprayed cheese over the screen it\'d still not be as cheesy. Really? This is yandare at it\'s finest, except when she denies him. Like he does everything right and she says no. So what does he do? Leaks the emails! Take your rage out on the guy who was only trying to help you win! Really??? Like Simon gave him the advice, he took it, and when she says no, he just does something so inconsiderate and bad you can\'t understand what he was thinking. Simon had nothing to do with some other girl saying no to you. Don\'t take it out on him... he\'s the Baby Driver himself. (Really look at the two... jeez...)So yes, this movie is fine. It\'s not nearly as good as everyone is praising it as, at least to me. I think there are parts that are extremely great, and parts that are absolutely awful. If you can look past some of the cliches and fully immerse yourself in the movie, and the good stuff about it, good on you. You absolutely have the right to enjoy it and love it. Don\'t let me and my nagging keep you down.', ""Here are my thoughts about Love, Simon:First, it was definitely the best movie adaptation of a book I've ever seen. Hands down. It was also an extremely authentic story to begin with, and it translated so well as a movie.Second, I wish this movie had been around when I was younger. The message of love and acceptance was so powerful, and the way Simon and his friends were portrayed was amazing. Kudos to the actors. The whole theater was cheering, laughing, and crying with them.Representation matters. Our kids need to see themselves on screen in movies like this."", ""I was afraid this would be so sticky sweet I'd end up in a sugar coma. I was pleased to be completely wrong. I identified with Simon (even though I finished high school in '84). The fear of losing your family and friends makes the secret you carry that much more of a burden. This movie helps us all find peace in ourselves and teach us to celebrate our unique traits. Put this down as a feel good classic that will endure. \nI'm happy I went."", 'I didn\'t think I would, but - I loved it.The first 15 minutes or so, I cringed a few times, thinking it was going to be too clever, too cute, and too precious for its own good.But even my cynical, hard-hearted self soon melted with the realization that the intelligence, depth, and charm were all legitimate and sincere.I left the theater with a full heart and am confident ""Love, Simon"" will remain with me as one of my favorites of this new film year.', ""Love, Simon is a very touching, heartwarming story about a relatable teenager with a big secret. This film is entirely relatable for anyone who has been in high school. Viewers don't need to share Simon's exact problems in order to enjoy this film. That's what makes it so special! The characters are all well-thought out and the story is very funny, interesting, and emotional. This is a film for everyone!"", 'Love, Simon is Hollywood\'s first attempt at a wide release gay film, and going into the film I was expecting something along the lines of a gay romcom, instead I got a watered down and unrealistic portrayal of coming out and the gay experience in general, which left me wondering how many LGBT people were behind the camera, and frankly in front of it. The movie has been called a modern John Hughes-esque film, but it completely lacks the sense of humor and depth to be compared to the likes of great 80s teen movies. Simon Spear (Nick Robinson), our protagonist has an admittedly perfect life, and just happens to be gay, which he has kept a secret his whole life, and no one, including his doting liberal family or open-minded friends he\'s known since childhood have suspected anything at all. Right there I felt I was being asked to suspend my disbelief just a little bit too far, I would guess that a family like Simon\'s, especially his mother who is seen making a sign that says down with the heteropatriarchy would have at least had a talk with her kids once or twice about homosexuality and how she wouldn\'t love her children any less if they happened to be gay. Simon\'s friend group consists of Leah (Katherine Langford), Ally (Alexandra Shipp), and painfully underdeveloped Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) who is defined by little else than his love of soccer. The gang is introduced when Simon picks them each up from school, but the groups interaction reads as contrived and unnatural, and I kept thinking that I was watching an advertisement instead of a teen movie. My next issue with Love, Simon is exemplified by the high school itself.We meet Ethan (Clark Moore) the only out gay at Simon\'s school who is black, gay and feminine, and plays a relatively insignificant role in the film overall. The way they portray Ethan\'s coming out is that it was easy and almost unnecessary due to his stereotypical traits, which is borderline insulting and again undermines the coming out process of gender non-conforming queer people, which the movie would seemingly prefer not to dwell on in favor of their white, upper middle-class and ""normal"" straight acting protagonist. The teachers at Simon\'s school are all over the top and out of place in a movie that aims for a semi-realistic portrayal of the gay experience. Both the vice principal and theatre teacher seem like they belong in a surreal teen sitcom with their antics and behaviors, most of which fell flat. The last act of the movie is when I basically checked out. Simon\'s coming out is involuntary, and he has no control of it, which makes it less satisfying when he tells his family, because it\'s already a forgone conclusion that they\'ll find out. Seemingly, Simon\'s entire school, including friend group have turned against him after his outing for various reasons and he manages to change their minds by posting a message on a popular school gossip site, which is used by every student in the school, or so they would like you to believe, and the finale scene on the ferries wheel must have taken place in a completely alternate universe because there\'s no way a big school like Simon\'s would care so much about two gay people meeting up in public. The movie gives us one gay kiss at the end, which is probably ten less than the average romcom or teen comedy, but because it\'s a gay movie they can probably only get away with one and still keep it PG-13. The whole movie just felt artificial and staged, as well as contrived, as none of the events that force Simon to come out of the closet ring true whatsoever. Overall, I think this movie is a step in the right direction, but definitely not one of the better LGBT movies of the last few years. The best scenes include a montage of straight kids coming out to their parents, and Keiynan Lonsdale\'s performance.Other gripes: The timeline of the movie is wonky, it starts at the beginning of the school year and goes into the end where graduation is now approaching, but this makes many events in the movie nonsensical. Why did Simon\'s dad (Josh Duhamel) spend seven months working on an anniversary video for his wife? Why did the school spend most of the year preparing for one show? The timeline takes some of the intensity out of Simon\'s pen pal relationship with Blue, which would\'ve been much more intense if it took place over the course of a month or so. Also, the scene where Simon is fantasizing about being gay and in college is borderline homophobic and is there basically to show the audience that Simon is gay, but not that gay, a message that is insulting to the gay rights movement and everyone who fought to make movies like this possible.', ""Important, relatable, anti-stereotype and all, but also cheesy, corny, and too bubbly. but you really can't make a film in this form to avoid those things, so this film is really for audiences who would enjoy this life-assuring kind of film. with that being said, i still have teary eyed at some scenes because i can relate to it to some extent but also combined with some cringeness attack because of the dialogue and all. could it better? i think it could, but that would kill the purpose of the film, so i'm glad that the film was made this way, but it's still not my thing."", ""Although I'm glad it's out there for confused teens to see (although at the showing I attended in LA the audience consisted of about 50 middle-aged women and me), Love, Simon the movie, like Love, Simon the novel, is a bit shallow to be truly moving and really needed to be set about 30 years ago. Just doesn't play as believable in 2018. That being said, kudos to all involved for giving it the old high school try and largely succeeding. (P.S. Where it failed big time was the musical fantasy sequence where Simon is leading a big number about what it means to be gay. I found that offensive to the max. And not just because Mr. Robinson is not a great mover!)"", ""Have seen TWO special screenings of the movie and I absolutely loved it. It's just a great movie, and the subject matter happens to be gay. It appeals to a wide variety of ages, genders, and sexual orientations! And the cast of the movie is diverse as well! It's the gay movie I've been waiting for my whole life and I have so much love and appreciation for having seen it. Whether you're gay, straight, or in between, you will absolutely love this movie! <3"", 'It\'s just a sweet coming of age story about a guy who happens to be gay. How refreshing to like all (or almost all) of the characters. No violence, gore, or really horrible people. Sure, it\'s an idealized version of reality, but sometimes we need a movie to escape into, as well as learn from. I would rate this 8.5 because there are a few moments that come off as less than perfect... but I rounded it up to a 9 because they took a huge risk: not about making a ""gay"" movie, but about making a positive, sweet, idealized one.', 'As a lover of LGBT movies on someone who has experience the coming out process, I felt this movie was way too far fetched and slightly cringey. The ending was so unbelievable unrealistic and out there what I was hard pressed to keep watching. Especially having read the book and how smoothly the events unfolded in the written version, I feel like the film adaptation was not entirely believable, and mostly just cheesy.That being said, I would still recommend people watch it as some might enjoy it. The protagonist was charming and cute as hell, and the whole thing was pretty uplifting.', ""This film arises some controversy, as anything would that deals with controversial subjects. While movies like Beautiful Thing and The Boys in the Band could pull off a controversial subject with grace, unlike movies like Ben and Arthur and this to an extent don't really pull the point across without seeming pandering.\n-\nThere are aspects to this movie that are good, the humor is decent, the main character is a good actor, and it's message is good for teens. The problem is, pandering. It wants to jerk off gays by showing a reality that's skewed. Homophobia isn't as common as the film wants to show, it's mostly people don't care. But it did seem to advert from the idea of more than 2 genders, which I'm glad about. If you want to watch a movie about LGBT, then go watch the aforementioned movies that pulled off the concept well. But if you're looking for a laugh at humor, to see some nice camera work, or laugh at pandering, this is for you."", 'SPOILER: \nStory:\naverage, plain, boring, mediocre white male Simon has only 3 charateristics that stop him from getting the ""most boring character ever"" award: He\'s gay, a coward, and is surrounded by the extremely supportive and loving friends and family.\nSince everyone around him is so supportive he\'s at no risk of ""coming out"", because you can obviously see that everyone is going to keep loving him no matter what.\nBut he doesn\'t. \nThen another gay person at his high school sort of comes out anonymously on the internet, in a chat room that apparently all of his high school reads.\nSo the coward starts chatting to him by creating a fake email.\nBut he\'s stupid enough to have his emails screenshotted by (deus ex machina) the weirdest and evilest teen male who just happens (deus ex machina) to like a girl that he\'s friends with, so he blackmails the coward into helping him get the girl.\nThe coward instead of denying such request, manipulates his friends in order to get the evil boy with his girl friend, because he\'s such a spineless coward.\nEvil boy gets shot down by said girl.\nEvil boy, for no good reason (deus ex machina), decides to then leak all the emails of the coward and his other anonymous gay friend.\nFriends and family want to help support him, but he only cares about his ""relationship"" with the anonymous gay.\n The very next day (deus ex machina), the friends realize they\'ve been manipulated, and are angry at the coward boy.\nThen, at cafeteria, gay boy is harassed for being gay, and not only does his friends do nothing about it, but the coward now (deus ex machina) has all the courage in the world to face the bullies.

I get the idea of morphology, the shimmer refracting dna and the idea of one's own self destruction to becoming something new/ different. Those ideas were cool, but that's not what I have issues with. It's hard to take this movie as a deep, intellectual movie when common sense and basic logic is all tossed aside. \nHere is a list of things that I couldn't get passed in this movies:1. The team. Only one person had military training yet they were all given automatic weapons? 2. The biologist doesn't wear gloves when swabbing specimens? Who cares about contamination right?3. Everyone they sent into the shimmer has died and never made it back except one guy who is dying and coughing up blood. They kept him in a quarantined area and wore hazmat suits around him, but they go into the shimmer unprotected?4.This is a military/government operation, where's the military? It would have made more sense to send a team of scientist in with a team of trained military professionals. I get the girl power in this, but you could have sent them in with an all female unit.5. You kill a giant, vicious mutated gator and decided the best mode of transportation is to get in the water on tiny row boats? People! We are talking about a gator that is on steroids and has severe roid rage! This place is a swamp! 6.Their idea of standing on guard at night is to have one person on the ground 200 ft away from everyone in a small guard shack that has no walls where something can grab you from all angles while everyone else was high up in a lookout tower. There was a balcony on the tower that had one set of stairs that went up it. That is where you put your guard. 7.Who the hell packed their gear? No night vision goggles? No secondary side arms? No masks in case of deadly spores?Now. I am not saying do not watch this movie. You can do whatever you want. It's your choice. You might like it and not be bothered by the things I listed.What I am saying is that I cannot agree with those that are praising this as the best sci-fi movie or that it's the most intelligent one. For every intellectually stimulating subject that's touched in the movie is quickly overshadowed by some boneheaded decisions and actions.There are (in my opinion) better Sci-fi movies out there.\nArrival, Blade Runner 1 and 2, Ex Machina, Any Star Trek movie, District 9, 2001, Alien and Aliens, Predator, The Maze Runner, The Matrix, Close Encounters, The Edge of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Interstellar, Dune...You want thought provoking movies? \nCheck out these:\nArrival, Memento, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, The Number 23, The Count of Monte Cristo..."", ""The ideas, and even scenes, in this movie can be found in a whole list of SF novels and movies from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse series), John Carpenter's The Thing, Alien, Avatar, The Astronaut's Wife, Blair Witch, Tarkovsky's Stalker & Solaris, and JG Ballard's The Crystal World. (In one scene I thought I was watching Ghostbusters.) It throws in some genetics jargon and wraps everything in pseudo-philosophical nonsense while adding nothing new.The story makes no sense. Perhaps the most significant event in human history and the investigation team seems to have the budget and staffing of a small university chemistry department. Over the course of several years many research teams have entered the Shimmer, never to return (mostly). Surely, by now they'd have nuked it? But no, they do exactly the same thing again with a new team.They go in with no back-up plan; in fact no plan at all. No protocols. Not even a bio-hazard suit? And apparently no paper and pencil for making notes, which would have been useful when they find themselves lost and with no memory of the previous 4 days. Really? They are supposed to be scientists.The protagonists do all the stupid things people in horror movies always do: Just been attacked by a giant mutant alligator? Sure, let's take to the water in small boats. Attacked by a giant mutant bear? Sure, wander off in the jungle alone. As with Garland's previous offering, Ex Machina, it's all style and no substance; nothing that hasn't been done before, better."", 'From the trailer I was expecting an action-packed sci-fi thriller... but I was very misled. What I watched was nearly 2 hours of mind-numbing tedious garbage. Nothing is really ever explained, everyone talks very slowly (I am assuming they are trying to create suspense, but it is very unnatural) - the whole setup just seems very odd and illogical for a group of women scientists preparing to venture into someplace treacherous and unknown.I will say the special effects and CGI were very good - so it did have spectacular visuals - the only reason I am giving 3 stars. Everything else was either mediocre or awful - and too often illogical.Spoilers ahead...Some of the stupid things that happen in the movie:Despite 3 years of study - sending in teams and drones - running tests at the perimeter - no one inside of a scientific (government?) facility has any information regarding what is going on inside of this bubble-like anomaly encapsulating an area of swamp and coastline - they call it inside ""The Shimmer.""A female psychologist plays the tough bad-ass character. Not the paramedic or former soldier - no the psychologist (you would assume a psychologist might be sensitive and sweet). And for some reason this psychologist has been making the decisions regarding who enters this anomaly (a.k.a. The Shimmer). I\'m not even sure she is part of the government - which I assumed was in control of the facility because they capture Lena\'s escaped husband in the beginning third of the movie.A male soldier\'s insides have been completely mutated and swirling around like a worm, but somehow he is still alive. Upon seeing this on video, a former paramedic exclaims it was a lighting trick and to not believe what they just saw (Aside: pretty much all of us in the theater burst out laughing).A former soldier is using night-vision goggles to see out into the dark - but she\'s standing in the middle of a booth-type structure with the lights on - which obviously would disrupt the ability to use the night-vision goggles.Cells extracted and plated from Lena\'s blood are rapidly dividing and mutating, but somehow she is not extremely sick and dying?The ending is so exceptionally weird that I\'m not sure a written description could even come close to accurate. It tries very hard to be artistic and deep / mind-bending, but instead comes off silly and trite.', 'A biologist (Natalie Portman), a psychologist (Jennifer Leigh), a physicist (Tessa Thomspon), an anthropologist (Tuva Novotny), and a paramedic (Gina Rodriguez) embark on an expedition into ""The Shimmer"", a mysterious quarantined zone.Our take: See it in theaters if you like pretty things, but skip it completely if you can\'t handle frustrating plots.\nPost credit scene? No.\nNot your standard sci-fi flick, Annihilation has a slow but promising start. It is full of excellent performers that give the caliber of performance you\'d expect from them - Portman stands out, but the rest of the female ensemble all hold their own while facing their personal demons and also facing a weird, and a seemingly hostile alien landscape invading Earth. Rodriguez is probably the most surprising. From her hair to her attitude she\'s 100 miles away from Jane Villanueva, the role she\'s probably most well known for.Stunning visually, yet not quite on par with Avatar\'s Pandora, it features the same sort of colorful flora and fauna. The score is compelling and well-matched to the film. But ultimately, it loses itself in convoluted science mumbo-jumbo and truly bizarre alien stuff.There are too many plot holes throughout to make a satisfying film. If you\'re looking for answers, you\'ll be sorely disappointed in the few if any, you receive. The ""science"" is shoddy at best. Only a few brief lines of dialogue are afforded to explaining the mutations in ""the Shimmer"" and they are unsatisfying and incomplete. It doesn\'t come off as the sort of movie you would be able to understand if you were just a little smarter, or a bit more well-read, instead it seems as if the issues it has are largely narrative. The screenplay purposefully doesn\'t give enough information and rather than feeling bogged down by too much science and explanation, we were distracted by the lack of it.The film just - got too weird too fast. And there wasn\'t enough good in it to make up for that. We\'re all for strong female ensemble films. We\'re all for talented WOC playing scientists and doctors. We\'re also all for smart and well-written sci-fi. This just didn\'t deliver.', 'I went with an open mind, as I\'ve never heard of the corresponding book. Alas, I was already laughing half way through, at the scene with bear shooting - so poorly constructed the plot was. However, the bear episode was just the first culmination of the incoherent pileup of plot stretches and pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo that badly needed a comic relief. For starters, one has to wonder why the biggest army in the world did not employ its might, or, say, just an armoured regiment, to investigate the phenomenon, but instead was sending tiny groups of volunteers for three years. Or, for example, why the gals abandoned a secure position on top of the guard tower just to be attacked. Or, one has to constantly scratch the head how come those pesky genetic mutations were able to merge different kingdoms of life and even fragments of conscience into all those new life forms. Or, on a related subject, where did the Cambridge physicist disappear to? Or, what happened to the leader of the team, really? Let\'s assume, it was magic. If so, why it was never acknowledged, but instead we hear laughable mumbling about HOX genes? These inconsistencies at some point become just really hard to bear. Without giving away too much of the ""plot"", or the lack of such, all ends pretty bad. Namely, after a spectacular animation sequence, which makes no sense whatsoever, all gets back to quasi normal, except there is an alien clone (or two?) in our midsts. The end. Of course, one also has to wonder, if it all was just a lie by the lead character. If so, why so elaborate? And what really, really happened with that ""little green man"" at the lighthouse... In short, easily - one of the silliest SciFi movies in decades.', 'Yeah this one wasn\'t working for me, dawg.It\'s been a while since I found myself at such a disconnect between the public and critical view of a movie and my own interpretation. Not since Dunkirk I think.Either way much like that one I can see why people liked this movie and I don\'t have any issue with the fact people do, it just didn\'t work for me. There\'s no real advantage to being the guy who doesn\'t like the beloved movie and I\'m not really in the mood to go into laborious detail to explain why I DON\'T like something, hence why most of my detailed reviews are positive as well as most of my reviews in general. I don\'t want to do this review at all and the least effort I put into it, the better honestly. So I\'m just going to do this review in a pros/cons list format.Things I liked about the movie:The environmental effects are really nice.Oscar Isaac was good in it, because he\'s Oscar Isaac.For the most part, Natalie Portman was good in it.A couple of the tense scenes were indeed quite tension-filled. Two in particular.The first scene where video footage is found of Oscar Isaac\'s crew descending into madness, complete with a highly disturbing scene of a crew member\'s stomach being cut open to show that his internal organs are moving.The mutated bear attack scene in the house was freaky, tense and legitimately compelling. If every scene were like that we\'d have no problem here.The premise itself, a growing orb likely to consume the world if unchecked, where inside all DNA is refracted and distorted, while not the most unique thing on the planet, is interesting and can be done well, and there were glimpses of it being done well here.The ending (although they basically gave away the surprises 5 minutes before the surprises) was well done and saved me from being truly merciless on the film.Now the bad news:The trailer was bad. It should have ended right before they ENTERED the shimmer. It would have been so much more interesting if the audience came into the movie wondering what was going to be inside. Roland Emmerich has been getting butts into the seats for his terrible films with this style of marketing for years. He can\'t make movies for the life of him, but he can make trailers. So as someone who saw the trailer multiple times during previews, I fully admit I was put off from the getgo. Then again although I was put off from The Post due to the trailer, I admitted it was better than the trailer made it look, although still not particularly good. But that movie ultimately was tonally different from how the trailer made it seem. With this one, save the ending and a couple details, if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.It took a bit too long to get into the shimmer. It would have been fine if in the near hour of exposition leading up to it, the film created more interesting characters than just Isaac and Portman, but pretty much everyone else in the movie is disposable... and was disposed of.In my opinion, the acting performances from any of our female leads who\'s name didn\'t rhyme with Shmatalie Shmortman, were either unremarkable, or flat-out bad. Unfortunately, I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actor who has been in other movies, and has been good in some of them, fell into the latter portion. She seemed to deliver all of her lines in a sarcastic tone, even when it seemed ill-befitting the moment or worse, unintentional.In the middle of their fight for survival, she finds a video cassette with writing to the effect of ""for those that follow"". Her response: ""Hrmph... I guess that means us."" If I\'m in the crew I\'m like: ""Not the time for sarcasm, jerkface."" That\'s what I would say. Jerkface. I\'m a badass.Basically all the dialogue in the movie is spoken in whisper, even when they\'re not in the shimmer. I always find that really annoying in movies. Comes off as pretentious. That\'s probably a me-only issue but when every line of dialogue is performed in a quiet tone to make them seem meaningful, it takes the drama away from the actual dramatic moments.So much unrealistic dialogue.""In a way it\'s two bereavements. Losing my daughter, and losing the person I once was"". Nobody. Talks. Like. That.A disturbing video portraying a man having his stomach cut open to reveal his intestines moving around like a snake. Professional medic: ""That was a trick of the light."" There\'s being in denial and then there\'s being a moron.Ultimately unnecessary flashback scenes that basically only served as trailer footage. Think the Batman in the desert scene from Batman v. Superman. A few of them provide decent exposition, but most of them were needless.Shephard, recipient of the esteemed ""worst actress in the movie"" award and deliverer of the great ""two bereavements"" line during a scene of exposition vomit on a canoe, is attacked by a mutated bear and very clearly has a 0% chance of survival. However, Natalie Portman declares ""we have to make sure"", just so she can go out on her own and we can get a trailer shot of two white cartoon deer. And the payoff to this scene... HOLY CRAP... she\'s dead. Speaking of the cartoon deer...Although the environment effects are beautiful, most of the creature effects are anything but. In any scene where there is bright lighting they look cartoonish and not really there. The good bear attack scene was aided by the fact that it took place during the night time. But the stuff with the deers, or the gator attack, didn\'t look very good.At the beginning, Portman\'s character is asked what happened to the crew. She says ""I don\'t know"". She then proceeds to explain exactly what happened to the crew in detail throughout the events of the film.The big monster at the end of it all is a machine that creates clones of people to the tune of weird psychedelic rock music... meh. It\'s completely superficial of course but just for me personally it was a little bit of a letdown.The scene of Portman interacting with her clone was effective, but why did the clone wait until it had a grenade in it\'s hands to stop mimicking Portman\'s movements? Shouldn\'t it have ran alongside Portman at the same time, ultimately blowing both of them up? I think it would have been a far more effective ending if Portman sacrificed herself in order to kill the threat anyway, but that would have required some actual bravery on the part of the filmmaker.The big bad menace is defeated with a grenade. I wish one of these thriller movies would actually end with a clever way to defeat the monster at the end, not conventional weaponry. Same problem with War of the Worlds. A pretty decent thriller and a threatening menace, and how is it finally taken down? A bazooka. Again, a me problem only. That\'s why I\'m not saying the movie is bad. I\'m saying it didn\'t work for me personally.The final Oscar Isaac video makes it clear that there\'s a pretty decent chance that he isn\'t the real one. Kinda takes the piss out of the twist.Maybe it\'s just the New York City tap water because despite the glowing reviews, in my theater there were a couple walkouts and some chirping of ""this is stupid"" behind me. But me and this film were just never in sync. It came off as a movie desperately wanting to be more smart and meaningful than it actually was. One person clapped. I\'m happy for them.', 'After watching this film I read the reviews voted ""most helpful,"" which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn\'t think about it while watching the film, but when it\'s pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.But I still really liked it. It\'s creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It\'s often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments.

But WOW! the movie just made no sense. The was no character identification, just nothing in the story made yo like or sympathize with anyone. There was no clear sense of direction in the story line or even in the editing. The acting was mediocre and lackluster. The characters themselves were paper this and stereotypical.

This might as well have been an invasion by fairies using magic to mess with us, hell, it would\'ve actually made more sense.Yet another horribly over-rated movie by people who wish to seem smart when mediocrity is beyond their comprehension. It wasn\'t the worst sci-fi movie of late. But it didn\'t offer anything interesting or have anything profound to say.', ""This is not a science fiction film. It is a vaguely pretty puff piece, that goes absolutely nowhere, says absolutely nothing and constantly irritates while doing so, with its lack of narrative, vagueness and utterly boring finale.It isn't true to say there are flaws in this film, because the entire thing is so fundamentally flawed and devoid of logic as to render the term meaningless. This is a vehicle for pretty graphics, nothing more.It does look pretty though so, hey if you're into CGI art then maybe you'll like it.Me?

Jurassic WorldÂ (2015) ,(2015),7.0,2h 4min,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']",PG-13,"A new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.",Colin Trevorrow,Rick Jaffa,"['Chris Pratt,', 'Bryce Dallas Howard,', 'Ty Simpkins']","['You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It\'s better than the original"". Don\'t believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg\'s own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn\'t hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. In a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year\'s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan\'s Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshingly light adventure flick, but let\'s not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg\'s magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the interesting, likable, and developed characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D\'Onofrio\'s bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. They are both likable in doses, and the script doesn\'t subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. Still, Jurassic World is a movie less concerned with characters than it is with celebrity personalities. Owen and Claire are not interesting, but Pratt and Dallas-Howard bring a lot of star power. For JW\'s brand of disposable summer adventuring, that may be enough. There\'s a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond\'s dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is somehow opened and fully operating. However, the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, prompting the scientists of Jurassic World to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that\'s a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter out. The rest of the film is a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous thing about a plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I\'ve seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn\'t have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.I do enjoy certain aspects of the film. The care that went into designing the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and its filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". It\'s a shame then that by the end of the film, any fleeting sense of wonder that you might have felt is replaced with Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment.Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow\'s filmmaking falls apart. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it\'s all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it\'s foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and drama. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the way he filmed the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from the Lost World. The action scenes of the first two movies were exhilarating without showing everything. They were subtle and scary and they exploded at just the right moments. Jurassic World\'s action scenes are loud, chaotic and devoid of any technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up machine gun toting mercenaries left and right, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight. and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It\'s the kind of mind-numbing chaos that can be loads of fun to watch while you\'re there but leaves no lasting impact. Such is the problem with the movie as a whole. Jurassic World is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the same empty feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works just fine. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg\'s first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and fun, but let\'s be clear, when it\'s all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 72/100', 'Let me just start by saying, I don\'t think this movie deserves a score of 1, but I had to rank it that low because currently the score is a gross misrepresentation of reality. This is not a movie which deserves to be compared with all of the great cinema masterpieces mankind has made.I just watched the semi-new Jurassic Park movie and I must say, I thought it was very, very stupid. I hate the trend in modern movies where everything bad that happens is always caused by people being stupid and doing stupid things. Like literally people making 10-20 Darwin Award ideas every movie. Literally in this movie, there is a big ""Super T-Rex"" dinosaur which is running around, and someone thinks that the proper move is to release a bunch of smaller Raptors to go hunt it down... like... what the hell...? You MUST be kidding. Raptors are PREY for T-Rex. It is a smaller predator which presents ZERO threat to the T-Rex, but MAXIMUM threat to humans. No human being who doesn\'t have a permanent retard helmet strapped to their head would have ever made that ""executive decision"". That\'s as stupid as sending a bunch of hunting dogs to go kill a Lion which is on the loose. Or a bear or something. And we are all little furry bunnies or something, so the dogs could easily just kill us for fun anyways. It is obvious that Raptors are only effective at killing small, human-sized prey... it just makes no sense. It is nothing but FRUSTRATING for the viewer, we\'re sitting here frowning and saying to ourselves, ""nobody would EVER do that!"".Anyways, MAJOR PLOT decision by the producing team... and it was a total disaster.. They should have gone back to the white board and came up with another plot idea.Another thing I hate are those STUPID ANNOYING scenes where everyone is running and frantically screaming in fear all around you, but the main characters are just standing there talking to each other like nothing is going on, just having a little chit-chat while there\'s dinosaurs running around, and people dying. Or when the two boys were running away from the T-Rex and then they got to the edge of a waterfall, but instead of jumping without hesitation like any normal person who is about to die would have done, they turn to each other and say ""Are you ready to jump? Let\'s do it together, OK? On the count of three, one... two... THREE, JUMP!"" Seriously, F that scene. That sh*t pisses me off so much.Stuff like that just makes a movie seem silly and stupid to me. I can\'t get ""drawn in"" where I feel the tension, and feel like I\'m right there experiencing the adventure with the characters. Instead, I\'m constantly reminded that I\'m watching the product of mega-producers and corporations, who think the general population is only interested in special effects and explosions and beautiful people saying stupid lines. I remember watching the first movie, and as the final scene was closing and they were flying away from the island, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, because I felt like I had JUST BARELY escaped the same dangers as the main characters had. I felt like I was there the whole time. But when I finished the newer, more ""modern"" JURASSIC WORLD, I felt zero emotion, absolutely nothing as the movie was ending. Instead, I just thought to myself ""Well, those were some really cool special effects, the movie sure had a large budget!"" In order for a movie to be captivating and really give the viewers a unique experience, you must mesmerize them and put them in a trance where they forget they are watching a movie. All those STUPID, HORRIBLY UNREALISTIC lines, actions, and mistakes made by the cast throughout the entire movie do nothing but slap me on the face each time it happens, only to remind me that I am, in fact, watching a movie.I would watch the first original Jurassic Park movie 10 times before I watch Jurassic World again! >:[', 'Two decades after the original Jurassic Park, the company behind it is overcome with greed and decides to capitalise on the dinos once again, but since everyone has seen Whatevertheirnameis-sauruses by now, they need to create new monsters to keep the ""Wow"" factor up.So it decides to produce the movie Jurassic World, in which, two decades after the original Jurassic Park, the company behind it is overcome with greed and decides to capitalise on the dinos once again, but since everyone has seen Whatevertheirnameis-sauruses by now, they need to create new monsters to keep the ""Wow"" factor up.It\'s either an irony of fate or a sly jab at the ever-fossilising motion picture industry that the storyline of the film and the narrative of its conception are so strikingly similar. And I\'m afraid I\'m not inclined to thinking it was intentional.As ridiculous as the premise of the film is â\xa0fill Dino Island with people, let a number of scary ones loose, and then indulge in blood and screams and make sure the obligatory two lead kids get away in the end, where on Earth have we seen that before? â as poorly written the script is. Apparently, the first draft only took three weeks to throw together. I\'m surprised it didn\'t happen in three hours. Loose ends are dangling all over the place like severed sinews from consumed tourists, the archetypal characters are nothing but a poor joke of the ones in the original trilogy (geeky and untidy computer nerd, lone hero scientist who understands that life doesn\'t follow spreadsheets, greedy business execs who want to make money from the monsters, and lo and behold, the Nasty Military Man who wants to weaponise them, et cetera ad nauseam), and when characters actually have to TELL each other to ""RUUUUUUUN!"" instead of standing still, waiting to become a quick snack, palm goes firmly on face, at least for this reviewer.You\'re-a-sick World indeed.

This movie deserves the right to be called back especially with all the money it earned especially in the first week it was out. It\'s been 14 years since the last time I saw Jurassic Park. I never would have thought that they would be making a Fourth one and when I heard they were making a new one I was ecstatic. It brought back all the memories of the first 3 films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic Park 1 did ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". The new park looked amazing showing that John Hammond\'so dream finally came true. The music was more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence. At the end of the movie we get to see the original T-Rex from the first movie roar for the last time after the park was closed for good. This movie brought back so many memories for so many people. I can\'t wait for the next one.', ""There is a young, handsome (I suspect), super skillful man, a charismatic guru. There is a young, pretty woman, a bit retarded and limited in her interests, often career-oriented. Monsters comes, people die, only a handsome superhero can save a day. A girl changes her shoes and/or shirt and becomes a superwoman in about 30 seconds, instantly gets expertise in gymnastics, combat, weapons handling, strategy and kills monsters together with a handsome guru (although the monsters had no problem with killing 1000 heavily armed troopers. Or maybe it is all that eating that made monsters slower?).The above is a screenplay for most of action/adventure/SF movies during the last 5-10 years. Doesn't matter if it is a new episode of Star Wars, or Jurassic Park, or Aliens, or some Passengers, or Interstellar - there are some superficial, cosmetic changes, but when I watch it all I can see no differences. It can be set in a jungle or in space, the clothes differ, the monsters can be humans, maybe there is a slight change in the roles played. But there is never any depth, no real personalities, no emotions, no basic logic. It is just colorful, fast, shimmering and loud. Am I getting older? Perhaps. If so, I am really happy and proud that I am not young if it means that I would have to have a brain capable of enjoying such a crap."", ""This movie is notable for being by far the worst of the series. The miscasting of the central characters is hilarious, and the screenplay is pretty much a lesson in how not to write a script. Bryce Dallas Howard is utterly wasted as Claire Dearing, a wickedly self indulgent and criminally irresponsible character who aroused such a sense of revulsion in me that I spent the rest of the movie hoping something scaly would chew her head off. It was not to be - but more than that, she triumphs, the lesson being that psychopathic bad behavior carries no consequences. There is also a farcical attempt to make her the love interest, again utterly at odds with her character. And as the for the rest, occasionally some good action sequences, too many people who looked like they just time warped out of the 70's, and generally a sour feeling at the end that I just wasted a couple of hours out of my life that will never be reclaimed. See it, but understand it for what it is - second rate garbage."", 'A dull monster movie without ideas, with all the imaginable problems: recycled soundtrack from the previous three film, poor visual effects (the \'93 film was indeed better even under this aspect, and that says it all), horrible ""dinosaurs"" that look more Godzilla than ""true"" animals (and yes, it\'s a very serious problem that these animals don\'t look or/and act as real animals, at least as they\'re conceived to be in XXI century and not in \'40s), badly-written dialogs (with a sort of ""love story"" that is embarrassing), characters (dull not to say stupid) and plot. All this problems all in once, and without any decency. To conclude there are the two boys, the most boring and annoying characters in the Hollywood\'s history.', ""First of all I think people need to understand that film is a lot like music, you can't listen to a new Justin Bieber song and complain because it's not a Mozart masterpiece. And you definitely can't watch Jurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type film. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael Bay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go through any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly entertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious throughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors to the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new unimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's rated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two years past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things, a plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did in 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction. We will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing the gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that Raptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what happens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are only a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the end, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and gives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the film keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and they did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are incredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your seat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have nothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just climbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption, well please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I think that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another for it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it a 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a comparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement and a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone who like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to just sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can only say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too after you watch it."", ""**** This Review May Contain Spoilers*** I ordered this movie because IMDb showed a 7 star rating. I don't understand how this movie could have deserved a 7. A new dinosaur has been created that is so smart it removes a tracking device from it's own body so that it can't be tracked. It tricks the handlers into thinking it left its cage by lowering it's heat signature. I fast forwarded the last 1/3 of the movie because curiosity got the better of me. I had to see how the script writers were going to dig themselves out of this one. Flying dinosaurs are loosed but the story ends without resolving this little fact. Driving a motorcycle among Raptors, which apparently have been programmed to work with the protagonists. Bad script and bad acting. Don't waste your time."", ""A really thrill of a ride. The Indominous Rex was a really cool idea and handed well. A lot of action and storyline. Most characters developed well and the last scene was a peach! However, there were some faults but they didn't destroy the film in any way, shape or form.The park was introduced in a very modern way and the teenager was like he would be, on his phone when there are dinosaurs!!! Staring at girls of course while queuing for the Gyrosphere was also very relatable.Glad the Trex animatronic came back...and didn't die because that would have disappointed me as it would have been a Jurassic Park 3 repeat. Though my jaw-dropped at the awesomeness that was when the Trex and Velociraptor fought together against the I-Rex. Seriously a really good film and (in my opinion) competes for the best of the four films."", ""I watched this on an airline flight. After 30 minutes I fell asleep. On the return flight I forced myself to watch the rest. Within 40 minutes of the start of the film I knew who was going to die and who wasn't, how the story was going to resolve (if you can call it that) and the fact that I didn't care about ANY of the characters. I also couldn't name a single one of them. There was more character development in the Flintstones. People did the same stupid things that NO ONE would actually do in real life (yelling when there's a big killer dinosaur looking for them, standing up on high ground etc.) The story was so thin it was probably written on a cocktail napkin. Special effects guys did the usual amazing job, and Pratt tried REALLY hard, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I was grateful when the turbulence hit my plane and the pilot interrupted it. I cannot believe that this utter pile of garbage took in a billion dollars. Please...no more sequels, take the billion and use it for some good, instead of torturing people."", ""Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of next\x85 Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!"", 'The 4th film in the Jurassic Park series and the second sequel that Steven Spielberg did not direct starts off well enough with enough call backs to the first film of the series but quickly turns into a monster movie with a run away super killer dinosaur that was spliced by the DNA of other prehistoric creatures for the sake of selling extra tickets. If my description of the plot Is pretty simplistic,it\'s because the story is that simple. So forget the dangers of science morality tales that both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" gave to it\'s stories and just accept that the series has become a standard creature feature that just swaps out it\'s main monster for every new installment. The last film in the series ""Jurassic Park 3"" pretty much threw away the whole plot lines of the first two films just to give us a chase film with a dinosaur that was never even seen in ""The Lost World"" and that film was set on the same island. While ""Jurassic Park 3"" just went on a painful 90 minutes long montage of talking raptors, horrible scenes of family bonding and an visible annoyed Sam Neill looking like he\'s about to go postal on the people working on the film set, Jurassic World manages to be a hell of a lot more enjoyable experience for the viewer in terms of just trying to inject a sense of plot and continuity to this other wise creature feature.As a standard creature feature, the movie works well and gives you your money\'s worth of dinosaurs doing collateral damage to property and personnel with the occasional park visitor being killed for good measure. Throw in your slack jaw good guy ( Chris Pratt) who feels that the creatures are misunderstood and works with good guy dinosaurs(I Kidd you not) to help stop the super killer dinosaur. Throw in an human adversary for our hero to fight with ( Vincent D""Onofrio) who would blow the whole island up to get this monster and add an human element like two lost children who are related to a employee at this crazy theme park who by the way has the hots for our hero and you have the entire story right there.It\'s hard enough to keep a franchise going, especially when you\'re dealing with dinosaurs walking the earth. You will eventually hit a wall in terms of storytelling if your primary goal is to keep turning these films out with out any care what so ever. We saw that with ""Jurassic Park 3"" where all the plot points from the previous two films were abandon for a B Movie creature feature. ""Jurassic World"" tries hard to correct that by having the movie be about something a little more and try to connect itself to the first film of the series. And Its much better film for it but it still ends up a creature feature all the same.', ""I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, it's my favorite franchise, my life revolves around it and dinosaurs. I was very nervous for Jurassic World, because it had been so so long since we've seen them back on Isla Nublar (22 years to be exact). This made me go into the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect, with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film, the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3, but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent franchise. It will be hard to make Jurassic World 2 better than this one, but here is to hoping!"", 'Spoilers - To be honest, I had low expectations going into this film. The lack of returning ""Stars"" from the other three films was sort of a let down but I have to say, Jurassic World blew me away. Even though I was hoping for some familiar faces, I was really going to see this film for one reason. Dinosaurs. And this film delivered all kinds of dinosaurs, both old and new. Sure, there\'s some plot holes and you really need to have a suspension of disbelief at some moments but that was the case with the original and it\'s sequels. I don\'t go to see Star Wars, Godzilla or Indiana Jones and pick it apart for it\'s realism or lack of, either. It\'s a fantasy ride and that\'s how one should approach it. I am also a huge fan of the other 3 JP films including JP3 which I see some folks bashing in their reviews here. I\'ve also noticed a lot of people bashing Peter Jackson\'s Kong on that particular page. I\'m not sure what their tastes are but I\'m a huge fan of old monster films like Universal Monsters, King Kong, Godzilla, Jaws and Dino films like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Valley of Gwangi and One Million Years BC. I thought Jackson nailed it with his version of KK as he\'s a huge fan and made a film he wanted to see and I feel the filmmakers behind Jurassic World nailed it as they realized what was most important...tons of DINO ACTION. Unlike last year\'s Godzilla, JW gives a majority of screen time to dino carnage. This is probably the scariest of the 4 Jurassic films and the ending was the grandest of all the films. Great ending. The T-Rex is supposedly the same T-Rex from the original. I loved the little cameos by Jeff Goldblum in the background on the cover of books, etc. I loved the homages to the original film by revisiting the original complex and using the original jeeps. The homage to Jaws. I thought Chris Pratt did a great job. All in all, it was a huge success in my eyes. I can\'t wait for the Blu-ray and I hope they continue with more sequels.', ""People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film since I saw it.

The way it was interwoven with flashbacks and the present and engineered with dramatic and unforeseen elements really made it quite compelling. It demonstrated the depths of love in a very effective way that stayed with me long after it was over.', 'I loved the storyline. The actors were very good too, they could tell the story through their acting and definitely made the movie even better.', 'I have been a sailor for 40 years, Adrift was realistic and at times terrifying. Filming in a tank or at sea is probably the most difficult movie making out there. Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin I thought were well matched together. For Shailene Woodley I thought this was her ""Monster"" from 2003 with Charlize Theron. This film I believe shows that Shailene has some real thespian muscle. She portrayed a capable sailor at 24 years old without that much experience at the time under her belt. It is wonderful to see film about the human spirit and not be overloaded with special effects, Tami Ashcroft has more grit than most and fair winds to her today.', 'Adrift is a love story with lots of adventure & suspense. The setting is beautiful, also.', 'Must watch, trust me! I was very skeptical but the movie turned out to be one of the best of the year.', 'Very well done, great story of determination and survival.', '""Adrift"" is a good survival drama that you know what to expect but Shailene Woodley makes it more emotionally satisfying than it would be otherwise. All the performances are exceptional, directed with good pace and beautiful cinematography and effects by Baltasar Kormakur.This realistic, suspenseful and romantic, true story it\'s not quite as exciting as watching Blake Lively fighting against sharks in ""The Shallows"" from two summers ago, but there\'s still enough of interest to keep the new nautical drama ""Adrift"" afloat. And of course it is always refreshing to see a film where a female protagonist isn\'t passively waiting for a rescue. Overall it is an entertaining film with a solid dramatization of real events.', ""A film that starts off as part survival adventure, part Nicholas Sparks love story. At first I began to question why they made the choice to inter cut between the present and then the past...how they met, fell in love and ultimately accepted an offer to sail a boat from Tahiti to San Diego. But then near the end, it all comes together and if it wasn't hard enough watching the movie, fearing the worse for Richard, then the one small twist just destroyed me, left in puddles.  After Spielberg finished Jaws, he told anyone that would listen, to never film on the open sea, ever. The elements, the waves, the weather and everything in between basically cause chaos. Director Baltasar Kormakur did not take heed to that warning and the result is something magical. To get the feeling of complete isolation, the cast and crew would sail out 2 hours from land to film. Kormakur is an experienced sailor and I'm sure that came in handy during filming. Half of the movie takes place on the open water and slowly but surely you see the two characters start to fade. They haven't given up hope but they are 1500 miles from land, have little food and little water. How Tammy and Richard survived 41 days on their own is a miracle. Tammy had to do it all. Take care of Richard, keep the boat afloat, catch food, make shelters and so on. There were times when she was in tears and close to going crazy, but she kept going, incredibly reaching Hawaii. She was not the experienced sailor, that was Richard. That makes it all the more incredible. There's one big plot twist and I will not reveal that here. If you know nothing about the story, keep it that way. Go in blind. It'll work so much better for you. Shaileen owns the movie. She's simply a rock. Her range of emotions are incredible and she has to carry the film most of the way. Claflin is good too but Woodley has much more to do. I simply love her performance and I really hope she gets a nomination this year. She's simply brilliant. I loved the movie. 9/10"", 'Not the typical movie i would pay to go see at the cinema, but Moviepass changes everything and the wife dragged me in. Must say i was glad she did. Up til now ive not really like Shailene, except for Snowden. But this suited her down to the ground i think.\nMovie was somewhat of a romance, a little suspense, good use of flashbacking and an unexpected twist.', ""Great movie that never lost my attention. Between the surprising twists (that I won't mention because they would be spoilers) and the intense action all through the movie I was glued to the screen. Shailene Woodley's great acting carried the movie like, in a smaller way, how Tom Hanks captivated in Cast Away. Definitely worth seeing. I would suggest see it without knowing much about the story."", ""It's a good date movie. It kept my attention and I loved the way the story was told. The characters really worked for me. Enjoyed way more than Ocean's 8 and Solo. It's a survival movie but also more."", 'I enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was fine and I thought that the special effects were above par. Other than a pop culture 2013 reference talking about a ""sick boat"" Knowing that that was never the reference in 1983 I would say I was thrown off a little. Also there was no music to tie you to that era. I actually didn\'t love how they went back-and-forth but the love story made up for it and I have to say I enjoyed the movie.', 'I really loved this movie, but of course, I\'m a woman, 56. Adrift is a heartbreaking, scary thriller, but really at its core it is a romantic chick flick. Beautiful ocean cinematography, both when serene and calm and when terrifying. Very good acting and chemistry. I\'ve never heard of either one of them before this film. \nThis is actually a very deep movie about survival and the subtIeties of the plot may not be noticed or appreciated the first time watching this movie- AND will hopefully lead to good conversation afterwards with whomever you watched with. I went in expecting to leave unimpressed and let down as this story has been done many times before with varying degrees of effectiveness. The ending pulls the whole movie together with a gut punch and, for me, the immediate need for a tissue! And then the ah-ha moments of understanding why certain scenes of the movie were, well, the way they were. \nOther reviewers are mentioning full on nudity. We did not see this at all. My husband cannot remember seeing even naked breasts, except for *maybe* in silhouette when she\'s sitting , back towards us, naked on the boat. So maybe there are two versions as another reviewer alluded to? We did see the 2 hour long version. \nThe only lingering question I have is why weren\'t the sails lowered long before they actually were lowered when they had plenty of warning about the coming\n storm? Husband thinks maybe they miscalculated the direction they were sailing ""away from the storm"". Would it have made a difference anyway? I think so.', 'There are two routes a movie based on real events can go- sensationalized or reality. ""Adrift"" felt authentic, yet deeply moving and riveting. This is a special case where the story itself is so beautiful and exciting and wrenching that the plot itself needed only careful curation, and the directors did so exceptionally. Combined with stunning cinematics, this was one of the best films in this genre (survival, stranded, hopeless, lost at sea) I have seen to date.', ""I don't know why all the negative reviews? Yes, this movie has been done before with the big storm and the boat incapacitated etc etc. But overall the movie is entertaining and it went by rather quickly which for me is a good sign on what a movie should do if its decent and this go by quickly."", 'It\'s a great movie, it\'s just best that you go into it knowing as little about it as possible. The movie tells its own story and according to Tami it tells it very well. It\'s one of those that has you whispering ""oh no"" and ""not again"" every so often and you really feel as hopeless as the situation must have felt at the time. It\'s also refreshing to have a movie that tells an exciting movie about ordinary people doing extraordinary things without something blowing up or morphing into a piece of machinery.']",/posters/xAdriftÂ (2018).jpg
GottiÂ (2018) ,(2018),4.7,1h 44min,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama']",R,The story of crime boss John Gotti and his son.,Kevin Connolly,Lem Dobbs,"['John Travolta,', 'Spencer Rocco Lofranco,', 'Kelly Preston']","[""The filmmakers had absolutely no idea what they wanted out of this movie. You can tell it took 44 producers and 8 years to make. Who was the protagonist? What style did they want to adopt? Is it a documentary? A character piece? A chronology of John Gotti's life? I couldn't tell. There was 4 time lines happening at once. Way to many names and places. It was simply boring and had no suspense. However, Travolta's performance wasn't bad, the script was. He definitly did the best he could with what he was given. Long story short, I have no more affection or knowledge of the Gotti family now than I did before the movie. Go watch the Sopranos instead."", ""I actually enjoyed this movie. It is flawed in the sense that it is really one sided and tends to glorify John Gotti instead of giving a warts and all depiction of his rise and fall in the Gambino family. To enjoy this movie you can't come into it cold, I think I enjoyed it more than most as I knew a lot of the history going into this and was familiar with the people and events depicted in the film. I think a person not familiar with John Gotti, Sammy Gravano, Frank De Cicco, the Gambino family and the other five families in New York would come out of this frustrated as this movie doesn't lay the groundwork, present their characters effectively or explain the relationships within the five families sufficient to tell a coherent story. In spite of the flaws I enjoyed this film and enjoyed John Travolta's performance."", ""I challenge every naysayer on these reviews to go out an direct a masterpiece their first try.Not a single director out there has, this film is far from perfect. But for a director whose still trying to establish his style, Connolly does a compelling job.Travolta's performance is also surprisingly good in comparison to his previous film stints as mob bosses.Critics are going to be critics, but if you have zero experience in the world of direction, I suggest you keep your mouth shut. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Connolly as a director."", 'John Travolta is quite amazing in this role. Eerily depicts Gottis demeanor and grit. The scene with Travolta and Preston was sadly all too real for these two parents who have lost a son. Story line, not so much.', ""Travoltas performance was shockingly good, But the movie couldn't keep pace. The story line was dull to say the least. I didn't learn anything new about gotti. Kinda got the B movie feeling. Dialogue was not great and the music seemed to not fit a gangster movie. Based on this movie you have to wonder why Gotti was admired by fans and sought after by the law. I learned nothing about Gotti."", ""When I heard that John Travolta was playing the role of John Gotti, The first thing that came to mind was that he is totally wrong for the role. As an actor, this role is too heavy for him. Somebody like Robert De Niro would have been better. It was just tough to take John Travolta seriously in the role of John Gotti. When it comes to tough guys, Travolta should stick with comical characters like Vinny Barbarino, and Tony Manero. That is what he does best. A lot of other stuff just didn't work in this film. The other characters were miscast, as well. And, the soundtrack did not fit the movie. They were trying to attract a younger audience with music by PitBull, but it just didn't work."", ""Gotti (2018) exposes the truth in living in a world that has lost priorities and hidden secrets. John Travolta's performance was outstanding and deserves recognition. The movie begins with John Travolta standing in front of the G.W Bridge (a symbolic representation of the fast life the Gotti family lived--from growing up poor and ascending into the mafia). The story of Gotti is one of love, hardship, loss, betrayal, division, and unity. The family's love and devotion to each other is admirable. This movie is important for all to watch to gain a better understanding of our livelihood."", ""I loved the 1996 version of this movie and they should have left it alone. Travolta was rotten as John Gotti. All of the mob guys were poorly cast as none of them appeared to be Italian. I didn't know what the heck I was watching and nearly left halfway through."", ""Good lord one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it free thanks to MoviePass but had I paid for it I would have been livid!\nThe story, plot, writing, directing, cinematography was all bad. The movie jumped all over the place. This was such a hot mess. Travolta didn't even save it. He didn't look like John. He didn't sound like him. Just awful."", 'I was looking forward to this movie for a very long time, I was happy when I saw this finally get a release date after the trouble with the previous motion picture company. This is a biopic, the central theme focuses on the life of John Gotti and also his son John Junior, who we learn wants to take a plea bargain, in order that he no longer has to deal with the authorities and can finally return to his family. Some of the highlights are the infamous hit on Paul Castellano and another turning point is the loss of his son during a road accident. Kevin Connolly does a solid job of directing, John Travolta portray a convincing gangster over several decades, Kelly Preston is great as the wife,Stacy Keach is the best supporting actor playing an impartial Neil Dellacroce. However I feel the breakout performance is Spencer Rocco Lofranco playing John Gotti Jr. It was interesting to see the portrayal of La Cosa Nostra, although I would have liked to see that aspect develop more. Resist the urge to pay attention to the trolls who have not even watched this movie, it deserves to be seen.', ""This movie is actually very entertaining and not nearly as bad as critics suggest. Travolta does a great job, minus the cheesy open and closing narrative scenes. Those should have been cut. Otherwise he was really good. I can't understand why critics hated this movie so much, even if not historically accurate, it was entertaining. And it gave some interesting perspective on what life might have been like inside Gottis family. See it and judge yourself. It was no worse than at least half the other movies I have seen this year."", ""A suspect in his own demise director Kevin Connolly's career as a director just came to an end and was sent swimming with concrete shoes."", ""One of, if not the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no story. The acting isn't believable. Wiseguys will probably find it offensive for it ever being made. DO NOT waste your money on this if you are thinking this is going to be a classic mob flick. Instead, stay home and rewatch Goodfellas."", 'There was no plot to speak of, more individual antecedents stuck together to try to resemble one. The only reason I gave this five stars is Travolta\'s performance was pretty good. That being said, Junior was right when he said that Travolta didn\'t have natural swagger. Another big problem is that the movie is very shallow. They completely omitted anything about Gotti that would potentially make him look bad - the ""activity"" on the Ruggerio tapes was that they were dealing heroin. Gotti didn\'t whack Paul to save Angelo so much as himself. They skipped the part where he beat a man over a parking spot, and none of the multiple murders he ordered were mentioned. Also, everyone except Kelly Preston as Victoria Gotti and John Travolta were miscast. \nThe 1996 HBO movie with Armand Assante was much better.', 'John Travolta plays John Gotti brilliantly, but I\'m left to wonder how you screw up a story that\'s basically already perfect for a movie. Also this comes off as self serving to John Jr and a little shady for other reasons. This is Travolta at his best as he plays Gotti perfectly down to his speech, body language, and mannerisms. John makes the movie fun to watch and without him this would be one star review. I also have to give credit to the man whom played Neil Dellacroce as he too did a wonderful job, and he and Travolta have great screen chemistry. Aside from that the screen play left me with more questions than answers.The producers messed with a great real life story that should have been portrayed exactly as it happened. When Gaspipe Casso was shot in real life he was ambushed in the middle of the day while sitting in his car eating an ice cream cone and listing to the radio. That could have made a great scene and been a highlight of the movie. Why change that to a shifty middle of the night meeting where you instantly know whats going to happen? This is probably the most glaring example but the film is loaded with these moments. Where were the government filmed walk and talks? Why not get into the jury tampering of the first three trials? Why take exhibits from FBI recordings and not use them in the context that they actually happened? John Gotti going on and bragging that its ""La Cosa Nostra until the day I die..."" is a famous FBI tape, why use that as an off the cuff remark completely out of its original context? Instead we are stuck watching boring scenes like when John Jr met his wife, his lame wedding, and a stupid amount of time focused on Gotti Sr\'s funeral cars along with idiotic messages from well wishers. I was also left to wonder about some of the name changes. It seemed to me that most of the real names used were for those that are now dead. As for the living they changed Mikey Scars name, who would eventually reach boss and then become a government informant to Rudy Scars. Frank Locasico, Gotti\'s consigliere is still alive and sitting in prison after going down at trial with Gotti, but they changed his character\'s name to Bobby Borielo and cut him out of the trial. I sure hope this wasn\'t to stiff an upstanding guy like Frankie Loc and his family on any royalties.', 'This movie was amazing and the acting by Travolta was GOLD! This movie is the definition of great life story, great acting, and the directing was amazing. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone especially to people who love mafia movies!!!', 'To have a great story to tell and do such a bad job is criminal.', ""If you go into thinking scorsese film, its not. However the story line is more based off jr's perspective and the actor playing him did well. Travolta got more comfortable in the role as the movie went along. the kid from entourage directed it and to be honest did a fine job. stacy keech was very good as well. Now i really loved the hbo movie but this wasnt bad at all , worth a watch if you go into with an open mind. The acting was pretty darn good in this movie. the 0 rating from critic is bs imo ,iv seen some really bad movies before and this wasnt one."", 'You\'re about to see a very close-up at John Gotti. Personally, I love this biography movie. It recaps those deep emotion of a man, a father, a husband, a friend, a boss and a king, etc. It\'s one of Godfather type\'s movies, like Goodfellas, Carlito\'s Way, Casino... It carries the most important concept to be a real-man. I say ""Leave the fear after death, be braved as a man.""']",/posters/xGottiÂ (2018).jpg

It was also educational and shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos.Wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!"", ""I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away."", ""Music is banned in Miguel's household after his musical great-grandfather abandoned his great-grandmother and her young daughter. On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most."", 'It was great. My favorite part was how the guitar playing was accurate.', 'A Pixar\'s masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.', 'Three words... WOW, what an amazing movie, the story starts getting better and better, such a beautiful story, with so much touching moments, amazing soundtrack, congratulations to pixar, total respect to you guys, Mexico is amazing!!! you learn so much about the Mexican culture, incredible.', ""Absolutely beautiful film. It touched my heart and soul like no other film ever has. Visually gorgeous. The acting was wonderful. That little boy, Miguel, was such a lovely, likable character. I wanted to reach on the screen and hug him. The songs? Wow, just amazing. Where there clichÃ©s? Sure, maybe but it didn't matter since the characters were original.

The quality of the movie is going beyond any expectations as it is brilliantly funny, extremely emotional, and the music is fantastic.

You can thank yourself later to spend your free time. Go pixar go!', 'The storyline was very unique, so was the concept of the movie. \nTo everyone who enjoys watching animations I would recommend this movie. It also has a educational plot, because it shows the importance of family and a bit of the Mexican culture. It was hands down one of the best animations I have watched.', ""It's not a secret that every time Disney's Pixar make people of all ages spend their holiday or weekend with their families on the theaters to watch their latest product, the movie must be full of lovable characters, funny scenes, memorable soundtracks, and tear- jerking scenes that would push a critic website like Rotten Tomatoes to score it above 90% or so. Just take a look at Toy Story 3 (99%), Up (98%), Inside Out (98%), and Wall-e (96%). As for this year, we have Coco. As I write this review, Coco already gained a score of 96% on the aforementioned website. Well, it turns out that critics (almost) never wrong when it comes to scoring. Coco helps viewers to remember that no one ever truly dies as long as the memories about them, be it good or bad, live inside the hearts and minds of their loved ones, that the real and true death comes when the records of the dead simply vanished and no one is left to keep them safe and sound inside their neuron system, a cruel fate that everyone on the planet share sooner or later. As terrifying as it is, we are left with the choice of how we are going to be remembered before we fade away into nothingness, is it by doing something remarkable? something evil? something amazing? embarrassing? or just something mediocre? You decide..... Another element that I fall in love with in this movie is the plot twist and what it brings to our protagonist, Miguel, and his family, dead or alive. I mean seriously, no one would ever see that coming, the shocking revelation that will make our mouth open wide and turn the tide of the story.It wouldn't be a Disney movie if at near the end of the movie, they didn't include at least one tear-dropping scene that would almost make everyone sobbing. This time, the heartwarming conversation between our hero, Miguel, and his great-grandmother, Coco (from whom this movie gets it's title). I swear to every divine being that had been, or has been, or being, or will be worshiped by humankind, the guy who sit next to me was rubbing his eyes for a moment (and honestly, I was ready to rub mine had tears leaked from both of my eyes).So far, this movie is really fine by my standard, every generation from every corner of the globe should watch it to remind them that death is not something to be afraid of for it is a part of our life that everyone will undergo someday, that no one ever truly dies, as long as someone still remember them in their memories, forever and ever.""]",/posters/xCocoÂ (2017).jpg

I love Ridley Scott's original 1982 Sci-Fi classic. It is my all-time favorite movie. It had mystique and infused my imagination. It was a unique experience; hypnotic & surreal. The sequel, not so much! My initial reaction of BR 2049 was that it's a gorgeous film. I was mesmerized by the striking cinematography and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I will go as far saying that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The rich visuals are so glaring it's hard to take it all in and grasp what you are seeing. From the opening shot you know you're in Blade Runner world. The overall look is instantly relatable to the first film and it's an amazing continuation in that regard. Also, the acting was excellent. The entire cast did a great job. However, once I settled into the film I realized that it is mainly a self-indulgent visual feast containing a weak story that lacks clarity & wisdom. There are obvious clichÃ© moments and in certain aspects the story is comical and naive. The movie delves into complex philosophical themes and asks important questions but seldom explores them. It's all over the place. You get the sense that the film is not sure what it wants to be? It's clearly style over substance. Lots of homage is paid to the original through awesome images but the plot is paper-thin with a few subplots & twists added to make it seem intelligent. But is it? Well, not really! I think the movie tries too hard to be smart but fails to engage due to its long running time & fuzzy story/script, which may end up confusing and distancing the viewer.BR 2049 has been most widely criticized for its length, and rightly so. It's overly long with some unnecessary scenes & dialogue whereas the first film was more subtle. BR1 was also slow-paced but in a different way. It had suspense and gradual progression to climax whereas BR2 is forced and even distracting at times. I love slow-paced films don't get me wrong! I can watch a film all day as long as it leads to a point and has tension. Certain films are deliberately made slow to establish a specific mood (e.g. Kubrick & Tarkovsky films). They draw you inside the film and make you feel like you're part of it. BR1 does this perfectly while the sequel is stretched out for the wrong reasons. It comes across as an excuse to showcase impressive visuals which is great if it moves the story along but not for the fun of it. BR1 had long takes and brief dialogue but it drove the story along smoothly and its characters behaved realistically. There was a seamless flow to it. It's humorous how BR2 tried to mimic this technique from BR1 yet failed because its characters talk & move super slowly unlike real life.Although it's a visually stunning film, I found it to be almost void of emotions and musicality. The characters were uninteresting and lacked emotional depth. In other words, I didn't care about them. I was not sure about any of the characters' motivations. In the first film, all the characters shined with charismatic personalities. They were unique in their own way and I truly cared about them. They embodied everything that makes us human. This was a vital element that made the original so special. BR2 on the other hand has sad and forgettable characters. It is a very sad film whereas the original had moments of happiness to mix up feelings and lighten the mood, which made it more realistic.The music in BR 2049 was the biggest let down for me. It just didn't make sense because there was no music. A strange mix of very loud noises with faint echoes of original Vangelis tones interlaced (I listened to the entire score to be sure!). The musical score by Vangelis in the first film was one of the key elements that made the original my favorite film of all-time. I love atmospheric films that are visually & musically driven to tell the story. The music creates different feelings that make you fantasize. It makes you feel the movie and think about it long after it's over. The music in BR1 was incredible. It set the tone of the film perfectly. There was a haunting eerie atmosphere that along with the images created a hypnotic feel. Vangelis mostly used an electronic sound but he also incorporated piano & saxophone for melancholic effect. Not so in BR2. They messed up enormously this time. I know it's not possible to recreate Vangelis but they could have at least tried to create similarly-styled music by using the original score as a foundation. Even better, they could have perhaps made a completely original soundtrack all together. Blade Runner is an atmospheric film that is about feel and therefore must have a perfect music to visual ratio. Sure, they brought back one Vangelis theme for nostalgia but it wasn't enough.To conclude, I enjoyed the film but unfortunately cannot say I loved it. I simply cannot fathom the enormous praise given by critics & moviegoers. I don't think they understood what made the first film brilliant. BR 2049 does contain the main elements required for a true Sci-Fi film but fell flat at further exploring its themes. The original film on the other hand is a masterpiece. It felt spiritual & spellbinding whilst the sequel did not. Should you go see it? Yes. I would still recommend fans and anyone curious to go see this film in theaters despite its evident flaws. But as a huge fan it left me disappointed. Maybe I had high expectations! I gave it a generous 7/10"", ""My boyfriend and I watched Blade Runner 2049 the sequel to Blade Runner (1982) on Friday morning at the local cinema. Perhaps we should have opted to watch it in 3D because the shots were wide and there was quite a bit of scenery that was a work of art.With that said, I felt as if Blade Runner is trying to create a sequel for itself more than offer the viewer a film. There are more questions created than answers are given. The 'bad guy' is still out there, his scheme is still intact and on the other side an army has amassed and is ready to strike. We are told about the army, but nothing has happened yet.Problem is I paid to watch a film and I want a beginning, middle and an end. I didn't at for the director to tell me I have to come back next year.Again, the images on the screen were rich and I wish I can satisfy my boyfriend like Luv and Joi can, but otherwise we are a little tired of Marvel universe, Star Wars remakes and Batman sequels. Please give us a good film."", ""All the problems with the original theatrical version of Blade Runner, which Scott Ridley fought against are here. Ridley has become the studio system.Blade Runner 2049, likely the least desired sequel in history, is making Philip K Dick roll in his grave. What is the point of this almost three hour-long sequel? Of course, it is to continue the film industry's addiction to sequels and make cash. That is it.Let me get this straight: the world is devastated and anyone who is anybody moves off-world, but people are living in spacious luxury in a casino drinking fine aged Scotch? There is beautiful white snow falling from the skies and sexy call girls approach you on the street? This world is for schmucks, but the main character has an artificial girlfriend with legs to die for waiting at home for him making dinner and giving him threesome sex? Someone book me a ticket back from off-world to Earth please!This was the kind of logical misstep that Ridley fought against when the studio released BR to cinemas with a gorgeous drive through the countryside at the end of the original. It makes no sense.Face it, this is the film that should not exist and by watching all these 'franchise' films we feed the stupidity of Hollywood.BR2049 is the same as the last 10 marvel films, the next ten Star Wars films and the Ghostbusters sequel, but is prettier and more visual."", ""This was a disappointing sequel that may very well break the camel's back. For it is not just a poor and boring sequel, but also destroys - really disrupts and breaks - the Blade Runner mythos.If I were the monthly new Marvel movie, the annual ritual of a stupid Star Wars film or the next fifteen Justice League whatever films I would be very worried.Blade Runner 2049 is telling people definitively that these sequels are not made for reason of meaning, entertainment, purpose or a fun time. They are stupidly overwrought, prequel-crushing accounting ledger lines.Ridley destroyed Alien and now is dismantling Blade Runner. Villeneuve had three hours to do something and did not. This film addresses nothing and resolves nothing. In fact, they took our money and reached zero conclusions. Replicants were made with a uterus in the factory and can have babies (despite the later models' shelf lives)? How? Never mind. The corporation was banned, but another like it and worse was born. Erm, OK. The tycoon megalomaniac is out there. Well, fine. This is a post apocalyptic world? yeah, which is why there are grand buildings with no one around full of beautiful space, there is clean snow falling and you can get beautiful attractive hookers who approach you for a good time.I want to thank my dear girlfriend for being so kind as to sit through three hours of this joke with me. She is so noble. Otherwise, this film was so silly that it even tarnishes the original. It should not have been done. It will probably wake up people to skip the next Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel whatever, Justice League, Lego Movie 18, whatever.A few cool technologies, sexy desirable women with gorgeous eyes and lovable legs and nothing else whatsoever except loads of damage to Blade Runner."", ""The title says it. Here goes: Prior to release the critiques are overwhelmingly positive and make out the sequel to be the second coming! It turns out there is either payola going on or the studio has photos of some people.The day before and on the day of release IMDb fills up with perfect 'viewer' reviews of said film propelling the sequel to IMDb 250 list. All these, er, reviewers believe this film is perfection with not even a speck of imperfection. 10/10 i.e. nothing at all could be in any way better! The sequel was in actuality unrequested and unwanted.The sequel sets itself up for even more sequels with unresolved or cliff hanger plots.I do have to confess that I found the actresses in 2049 sexy and worth fantasizing about. Those were the real tens here and so I cannot give BR2049 a mere 1, which is something TFA deserves. Obviously Ridley and Villeneuve are better crew than JJ Abrams and whoever Disney hires, but it has to be said that BR2049 was a disappointment and I wish it were not made. The bar was set so high to begin with."", ""They say most sequels (and prequels and remakes) are unwanted and inferior and, in my opinion, they are correct.I still shelled out the quids for Blade Runner 2049 because I remember watching it on video years ago and recall having a sense of wonder and amazement. I even proceeded to read the book by Philip K Dick shortly after.At over two and a half hours of it this is a true accomplishment: the graphics and scenes and landscape and colours are amazing and evocative. With that said there is a lot more daylight in this film than in the prequel. For some reason the colour orange seems dominant, which is fine perhaps they wanted to impress on us that the setting is a desert and deserted, but overall the futuristic and cyberpunk land is intact.. and beautiful.Also beautiful are the women. The hooker reminded me of the hooker in Eyes Wide Shut and she was hot. The girlfriend was hot and even the chief's legs were hot even though I don't go for women with short hair. As a man, the shorter the skirt the more attractive the lady and this film did a stellar job of making me feel happy in that respect, heck, I would marry the giant advertisement if I could.Where the story lost me and disappointed was its ending and beginning. Why kill the man who is nothing but a farmer and has been at it for 30 years? Why end the film with having killed an operative, but leaving the arch fiend and his business interests intact and ongoing? I sense yet another sequel coming..."", ""Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim and commercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wasting daddy's money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes of endorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I roll my eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 was inane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lesson Hollywood didn't learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes it and all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and, of OK, let's keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke. A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and make babies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno, which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and go back home."", '""Blade Runner 2049"" comes off incredibly long and boring. Not because of the slow pacing â ""Blade Runner"" had slow pacing too, but had the viewer hypnotized â but because there\'s no interesting thoughts present and nothing new really. Thematically the movie is exploring the same questions (about being human etc.) as the first movie did 35 years ago. And the few \'new\' additions to the Blade Runner universe are totally devoid of originality. Take for instance K\'s hologram-wife. Not only are those scenes totally unnecessary (that three-way scene, jeez!), but we\'ve seen the concept so many times before (for instance in Spike Jonze\'s ""Her""). Apart from that, the movie is riddled with plot holes and stuff that just don\'t make very much sense. Tyrell get\'s killed off by a replicant and his Nexus-7 prototype runs off, shortly after Tyrell Corp rushes a line of replicants with OPEN ENDED lifespans and no other safety device than implanted memories (that didn\'t work with Rachael). No. Just no. Furthermore we are told the nexus 9 are programmed to obey. However K lies to his superiors, constantly acts on his own, acts emotionally from early on in the movie. He does not obey at all. And the revelation of a replicant child being born has people talking about revolution. Robin Wrights Joshi says it will \'break the world\'. But how? Rachael was the only replicant able to give birth and Tyrell took that secret with him. Neither the few remaining Nexus 8\'s or the 9\'s can give birth â so no, it doesn\'t break the world. It doesn\'t break anything. But the movie really wants us to take this very seriously (Hans Zimmer is doing his loudest to make us sit in awe). And it gets even worse. Later we learn that Jared Leto\'s ridiculous bad guy Wallace (those monologues!) strives to learn the secret of making replicant babies. But why? That undermines the entire idea of replicants. Tailormade slaves with superhuman ability; strength, intelligence etc. that are controlled by implanted memories. Having replicants make babies the old way would offer zero control of the outcome and the child replicants would have to grow up, go to school, make their own memories. What\'s the point then? And what\'s the difference, from just having some people make babies? A lot of people has called ""Blade Runner 2049"" \'intellectual sci-fi\' and so forth, but I found it to be quite the contrary. The movie forcefully demands you to accept it as highly intelligent art, but if you scratch the surface, you\'ll find something very different.', 'Blade Runner is one of my favorite films of all time for a number of reasons: 1) Amazing groundbreaking trailblazing visuals that spawned an entire genre (aka ""cyberpunk""). 2) Superb music by Vangelis that is integral to the film. 3) Great characters and amazing acting. 4) Underlying philosophical themes of corporate oppression (Blade Runner is just a small cog in a huge machine just carrying on with his life doing the job because otherwise he\'s reduced to nothing), existentialism (what it means to be human) coupled with Biblical references presented in a subtle way. 5) Amazing practical special effects that make the world around the characters feel lived-in. 6) Meticulous attention to detail, lighting in particular. While ""2049"" is nothing more than a mere attempt at recreating something in the style of the original by a studio committee ticking off the items in the checklist. The result is abysmal because it does not introduce something new in terms of visual design, interesting characters, music or story. On the contrary it tries so hard to tie itself to the original it\'s sickening. Call it fan-service or pandering, either way it leads to the movie being a highly derivative product that exists solely because of the original.1) Plot lines that go against the premise of the original (Nexus 6 being able to reproduce, new Nexus 8 being easily distinguishable from humans) are stupid. 2) Acting is horrendous. Ana ""Pouty lips"" De Armas couldn\'t hold a candle to Sean Young not to mention the pretentious for pretentiousness sake Jared Leto. Ford is here for a paycheck and Gosling is deliberately one-note. 3) The music is a lame attempt at copying Vangelis\' beautiful score.4) Too varying visuals leave you with this feeling of an inconsistent world that doesn\'t follow the idea of polluted lifeless post-industrial world where the sun doesn\'t shine, it\'s constantly raining and the only light outside the building is that of the advertising that seems more real than anything else. 5) Running time. The original was purposefully slow while the overblown running time of the sequel comes off as director loving certain sets and trying to savor them far longer than he should\'ve. 6) A myriad of logical mistakes and plot holes (kids with a 100% matching DNA are of different gender).7) The opening shot with the closeup of an eye is almost beat for beat with the original. 8) The zooming sequence is hammered home by the sheer repetition. 9) The characters are bland, unoriginal and politically correct female copies of the originals, namely Madam and Luv. 10) The opening sequence is the unused part of the Fancher\'s script (watch Dangerous Days documentary). Overall it seems that producers/writers have an erroneous idea of made the original film great. As if stuffing Biblical references into Neon- lit set pieces, inhabited by some pale copies of original characters and extending the awkward silences would amount to a great movie. To sum up ""Blade Runner 2049"" does not reinvent the wheel, does not offer anything one-of-a-kind or even slightly memorable. There is no reason (other than cash flow for the studio execs) for it to exist. Save the cash and rewatch the original that actually challenges your intelligence and leaves you with a lot to think about.', ""What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother."", 'SPOILERS ALERT: The biggest difference between 1982 masterpiece and this one is that in the first film everything is happening at a normal speed. In original movie people talk like they talk in real life, their move at perfectly normal, every day, common speed, it doesn\'t take them forever to finish the sentence, or to shape out a thought, and yet... somehow it all works perfectly together.There\'s no way to know how will people (let alone robots) act or talk in thirty plus years, but if it is to be anything like in BR2049, I suspect it will be a pretty bleak and exhausting world.From the moment one, everybody talks, walks, plays, runs in some super-strange slow-mo: I\'d say at 50% of the normal speed. It takes 10 seconds for poor Ryan Gosling only to take out something from his pocket. Not to say how long it takes him to walk through the scene - so much that half way through, let\'s say, the orphanage part, I have already forgotten what is he doing there in the first place.20 minutes into the movie, all I\'m doing is wondering when this shot is going to end, when this scene is going to end, when the sequence will, and, ultimately, when the movie is going to end. This is not the way to pay a homage, to anybody or anything.There is a reason why the shots in ""2001 Odyssey..."" are that long, somebody should\'ve warned the director about that. And there\'s also a reason why all shots in the original BR are that tight. And that\'s just one of the reasons to why both 2001 and BR are masterpieces. And for that same reason, BR2049 could that never be.You don\'t drag out every single aspect of the movie just to make it seem serious or pretend to be an artist, no. If you do, you get very expensive, anemic boredom. I have no idea why the director did it - he hasn\'t done it in that fairly fair movie with Hugh Jackman. What possessed him to do it here? Was it the importance of the first movie? Was it his fear to look like a schoolboy in front of the Master? Don\'t know, don\'t care.What a waste of great actors, class all - forcing them to engage in some sort of quasi elevated, quasi profound, but genuinely bizarre ballet that has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with the real life. The movie is three hours plus long only for the given reason - it would have been an hour shorter if had played out at normal pace.Oh - and to end here - the biggest dread of all: a hint of a possible franchise. Please, please, please people, for the love of all that\'s holly. Don\'t.', ""The answer? Don't Do It In The First Place!Who needed a Blade Runner sequel? Nobody! It is like watering the sea. It is not required!! What is wrong with the studios? Everything is either a sequel or a reboot. Boooooring. Find another line of work if you are out of ideas. As much as this film (Blade Runner 2049) was a relatively good film it still was a sequel, which meant it was boring, silly, disjointed and regardless of all the good reviews was a waste of money. As for professional film reviewers: your job first and foremost is to review for the audience and not to be beholden to studios that offer you free screening. Shame on you.This film was nice to look at, had a good actor (Gosling) in it and a really hot chick which were factors that drew me in. When I put my bum in the seat though I was bored. Booooring. There is no ending and the beginning makes zero sense! The tycoon is making replicants but is killing the ones already there. Blade Runner is retiring replicants, but they are useful and peaceful. Rachel is back (yup its Boring Wars: the face awakens all over again) via CGI, but why? Nobody knows."", 'I didn\'t realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. ""And what can your maker do for you?"".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannot remember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which made the original the best sci-fi movie ever. I take the same view as Rutger Hauer recently did. Why even try to do a second one? It would be as painting a second Mona Lisa. Or building another Eiffel tower.A huge disappointment of a sequel that should never have been made.', ""Please be aware that my review contains spoilers so please do not read further if you do want to have key plot points revealed.First things first, I'm a big fan of the original and have enjoyed immensely with each viewing, first from when I was a 10 year old until 2 weeks ago so I was interested to see what Villeneuve would do with the sequel.Watched it Saturday and must say the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed and frustrated at seeing such an opportunity to do something original go to waste, that I have decided to post my thoughts here on IMDb for the first time.In no particular here are some of my questions and general points about the film.Jared Leto's performance. How the hell is he such a high paid star? I cannot think of anything he is particularly memorable and this is no exception.His eyes. Are they distracting on purpose?If his character saved the world from starvation, how come there aren't millions of people worshiping him? Humans are suckers for finding idols and why should his character be any different. Crikey, we have dictators in our world who had days and months of the year named after family members. Why doesn't Wallace have a massive army organised to hunt down Deckard instead of entrusting this to one replicant and a few goons?Monologues giving exposition is lazy storytelling and old Wallace loves a monologue.What is his plan? He wants to produce more replicants but kills one at the start for some spurious reason. Hint hint, to show the audience he is a very naughty boy. He also has the Rachel replicant killed. No wonder he cannot make enough replicants if he keeps killing them.Ryan Gosling plays Ryan Gosling again and although I don't dislike his performances, I find it hard to root for his character here, as I've seen it before in a much better film (Drive).The music wasn't particularly memorable and only made me think of the much better soundtrack from Bladerunner. Apparently this was intentional on Villeneuve's part as he removed the original composer who wanted to do something original. So instead, the director opted for Zimmer to make it more Bladerunnery and therefore less memorable for this film. The film did not merit or need the run-time it had. I appreciate the original BR took its time but it had a new world to show usThe ending was goofy and ridiculous. Why would K bring Deckard to his daughter who is the most wanted person in the history of wanted people? This will definitely endanger her given that Leto's character has a relationship with her and probably has her under some sort of surveillance. Hero comes back from the dead to save the day clichÃ© at end was extremely predictable and had me rolling my eyes, which I shouldn't be doing when watching a film for the first time.The blackout sounds like a much more interesting story than this. Caused by replicants? A solar flare? Was there a Trump two term presidency in this universe?Robots reproducing and creating their own has already been covered in Battlestar Galactica, who did it in a more compelling fashion with characters and stakes I cared aboutPlus, how come Leto's character hasn't figured out on to get replicants to reproduce? Why can't he produce them faster? How many has he killed before delivering a monologueSome of the visuals are stunning though lack depth or colour. The future looks fairly boring in comparison to Bladerunner 1982, which offered some very unusual street shots and characters. One scene included a guy with a eagle on his head. Nothing to really catch the eye in BR2049. Why not have Rachel as leader of the rebellion instead of some random person the audience has no connection with. When the capture Deckard, why on earth wouldn't they kill K? How did K know how to find the car with Dekkard at the end? We don't see him doing any investigative work to discover this information, despite the long run time.They made a replicant clone of Rachel but get the eye colour wrong? Seriously?How heavy handed was the prejudice? No subtlety whatsoever. Jeepers, you spend all that money on effects but then go minimum wage on screen writers. That sex scene reminded me of Ghost with all the syncing going on. Watching Whoopi do her thing was just as sexy as watching this scene, despite it having two incredibly attractive women present, along with Ryan Gosling who is no slouch himself in the looks department.The replicant rebellion feels shoehorned in rather than something which has grown and developed organically. Need to take lessons from Star Wars on how to introduce a rebel alliance story.The golden rule of cinema is broken here when they show/play clips from a much better film.Critics are only offering gushing praise for a film with considerable flaws because they don't wish to get caught out like the critics of 82. Back then, the critics hated it because they couldn't see the hidden depth. This time they see depth that simply isn't there. Even one of the characters says something along these lines to another."", 'If you want to see someone stab a man in the back and chain another and hook another, even though he is ""supposed to be"" a ""replicant"" or a robot, this is the film for you. The writer/director/producer and every other contributor to this utter piece of trash buys into the notion that the gender roles should be females are all powerful (like an assassin or the police chief has to be female) and males should be reduced to the level of robots/order takers designed to serve female desires for any type of sexual perversion (even the female holograph tells the man when she wants sex), blood lust, and subjugation of others. I watched this overlong, tedious, and boring film for about 2.5 hour (it runs for almost 3) and decided that I have much better ways to spend my time than this misandrist trash.', 'My goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slow-mo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege.I guess, we should have known better since it is a sequel.All that rescued this film was several hard body, super thin, flaunting babes. Yup, those ashamed of the human body, nature and heterosexuality should stay away too. Otherwise, without the chicks the film would be a complete bust.', 'BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big ""plot twist"" that I won\'t mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big ""twist"" is mentioned as the ""miracle"", but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did ""that"" might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable ""obedience"" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems\x85 But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more ""like humans""\x85. On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell\'s successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the ""original"" Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty\'s death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage.']",/posters/xBlade.jpg

Jurassic ParkÂ (1993) ,(1993),8.1,2h 7min,"['Adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']",PG-13,"During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.",Steven Spielberg,Michael Crichton,"['Sam Neill,', 'Laura Dern,', 'Jeff Goldblum']","[""Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."", 'My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond\'s investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond\'s two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen\'s corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park\'s security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex\'s cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I\'m surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that\'s not what I\'m going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It\'s timeless and I can\'t wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10', ""This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!"", ""What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all."", ""Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that I saw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had a good plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"", ""It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10."", ""This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man."", ""By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.""]",/posters/xJurassic.jpg

Also its laugh-out-loud funny at times... I've seen a ton of coming out movies - and they are usually just preaching to the choir - just made for a gay audience - who already have their own coming out stories - but this film concentrates on more and winds up having a much broader appeal. It reminds us of the girls and guys in our spheres when we were young who were there for us and supported us even when were weren't quite ready to say who we were yet ourselves... and even though they weren't prefect allies - and even though they didn't always react in the most positive of ways... when the chips were down, they were there for us. \nIs this a perfect movie? No - not at all - but its a nice sweet, heartfelt, often dramatic, often comedic movie that is a very pleasant diversion for gay and straight audiences... It's not gonna win any awards (but neither did Pretty in Pink or Sixteen Candles) but it just might win your heart... Special kudos to Daniel Zolghardi who is laugh out loud funny as Dell - and Daniel Doheny as Alex who is so adorable and charming that we fall in love with him as easily as everybody else in the movie..."", ""This is an accurate depiction of coming out. Other reviewers seem offended by the focus on his relationship with a girl, but I don't understand that. It's very realistic and an aspect of the coming-out experience. I think this movie did a very good job of highlighting the roles of those people and other friends in the lives of lgbt.I also really appreciated the later-in-life realization of his sexuality. Yes, some people 'always know,' but some people don't, and others are in huge denial and that can really suck. These people need representation, too, and this is a great movie to do it with.Even the poor reviews give the acting good marks. I think I can speak from experience that the story is very authentic. No aspect of it rings untrue, and it manages to be genuinely hilarious at just the right times. 8/10"", ""I just wanted to watch another stupid movie to keep myself distracted. I had no idea that this movie would touch me so deeply. \nIt was funny and sad. \nThe name of the movie is stupid which lead to me thinking it would be another useless Netflix movie. But my assumption turned out to be wrong. I'm definitely gonna watch it again.\nIn my opinion it was better than Love, Simon."", ""I admit, this movie won me over. The first 10 minutes feel a bit cheesy, but, the tone quickly evens out and it just gets better and better, all the way to the end. Amazing and realistic performances; Alex is incredibly charming and Dell is hilarious! The music is great, hope they release a soundtrack! My one criticism is that Alex and Elliott don't get to spend more time together. Sequel? Anyway, ignore the hater reviews and treat yourself to a fun movie!"", 'Its got a nice premise and an honest attempt but its been done before.

Resolves at the end. good camera work. The dynamics aren't forced. The character makes mistakes but Isn't unlikable. shows both sides of the story."", ""This magical little film is perhaps a less constructed and truer to life movie than similar efforts like the more contrived 'hollywood' treatments of coming out, like 'Love,Simon' , which seemed very fake to me. This is a far superior film. The storyline flows gently and smoothly towards its finale - which I won't spoil here- and deals with the complexity and struggles of teenage sexuality. This is a film for everyone but speaks particularly to those questioning their sexuality and puzzled by having to find an explanation for their feelings. \nIf you are Gay, you will love this. If you are Straight, you will relate to it as well. And if you are homophobic hopefully this little movie might teach you something. Highly recommended!"", ""I cam into this move already thinking about Love, Simon and how it has to be an inferior film because it didn't get the theatrical release and the acclaim that the first film did. I was surprised and in the end I was left feeling this might be superior to Love, Simon. As a gay man, who am I to say how a film's protagonist needs to come to their understanding of their own sexuality? That's just wrong. Everyone has an individual journey that is wholly separate from what anyone else experienced. So the Alex comes to his identity after trying to love a woman. What's the big deal? I know that happened for me. It might not resonate with those who live in more liberal places, but for someone who grew up in the Midwest, this rang true. In many instances this film was more realistic than Love, Simon because it dealt with love (whether heterosexual or homosexual) in a frank fashion. I'm not one to chime in all the time, but I feel that the reviews this movie has gotten are unfair. It's a journey of self-discovery. It's a film that captures the essences of what it's like to know who you are, but desperately tries so hard to deny because what you are is different from society. No matter how things have changed, it's amazing how most things have stayed the same. Alex is all of us. He's just trying to find himself and conform to society and it's a journey how we reconcile who we are with what society wants us to be. I thought the friends were genuine, but much more so the relationship that Alex has with Claire is so completely believable because it happened to me. You are so afraid of losing the person who knows you most, even if they don't know the secret part of you, that you go along with it until you simply can't anymore. In short, this is a perfect film...almost...I don't get the homophobia...because...unless something has changed in the last few years...it's all true. Many of us start out homophobic and end up gay. We don't do it because we hate ourselves, but it's more of a natural progression from resistance to acceptance. Alex Strangelove is more of us than maybe we would like to admit.P.S. THANK GOD WE GET ANOTHER GAY FILM THAT GIVES US A HAPPY ENDING SO SCREW EVERYONE ELSE...WE DESERVE A HAPPY ENDING!!!"", ""I really enjoyed this movie, it was a rollercoaster of emotions, I was so scared Alex wouldn't see Elliott again but I really enjoyed the ending even though I would of liked a little bit more between Alex and Elliott expressing their feelings for each other but I'm satisfied!"", 'My question is; is this a coming out story or about a person finding himself? I\'m not sure. Maybe they couldn\'t settle on one and got stuck in the middle of the two, but not really pulling either plots off. It had a promising trailer and I did laugh at many of the jokes but as the last (and very predictable) scene played out before me I felt like I hadn\'t really learned anything about anyone and Alex was just... kinda gay? Who knows.If you\'re looking for something cute or heart warming this is not it. Period. It\'s about ""we\'re gonna have straight sex, oh yeah, but wait I can\'t get it up. But I\'m not gay! I will try with some random chick! Boooh Yeah! But I can\'t get it up this time either. Gosh darn it. Omg I\'m having a (wanna seem poetic much?) flashback; okay I\'m gay.

Funny heart felt film that deals with real issues growing up as a teen nowadays.', 'I think this hit it out of the park! Great movie about millenials coming of age in 2018...a modern ""Pretty in Pink"", but much smarter. It explores sexuality in a sensitive, intelligent was with laugh-out-loud moments. I wonder if the lower ratings are from younger audiences, who don\'t appreciate how far society has come, socially. This probably should be rated R for explicit language, but otherwise a great movie to watch with teens you are concerned about and whom you, as an adult, would like to support. Give it a shot! Really fun, interesting, inspiring work!', ""I'm glad a film featuring a gay lead has more raunchy, sometimes scatalogical humor. As a society we need to move on from tragic gay love stories and more fun comedies. As a 18 year old myself, Alex Strangelove depicts high school pretty accurately, and having made a student film similar to Alex Strangelove, complete with sex humor and absurd, surreal images, I think more people need to see it and it's great."", 'This movie is AWESOME....F ing awesome..... I have never seen a film that touches on the Bi subject in high school. And the writers did it in such a funny, different, current, cool way. Whoever wrote this needs an Oscar...seriously.

Thank you Netflix for bringing it to us!', ""I disagree with previous reviews, this is an honest (not too negative) depiction of gay love and coming out.

The cast work well together and it really is great feel good film!!\nMuch better tha Love Simon!!\nI cannot recommend this enough!!"", ""I watched the movie without many expectations, this turned out to be a good thing. Not that it is totally bad, but it is very mediocre. The characters do not really evolve, and the story does not even properly focus on the central subject of it (namely Alex's finally realizing he is gay). The biggest part of the film is about him having (or not) sex with his girlfriend Claire, instead of depicting why he is attracted to Elliot and how he decides to deal with it. Elliot's presence (who actually triggers the whole conundrum) is treated as a mere side effect in the film, totally missing the point. After a long absence, he magically reappears at the end, saving the day (sort of) and of course dealt with in an extremely unbalanced way. While Alex's try to have sex with Claire is depicted and described in every little unnecessary detail, his envisaged (?) relationship with Elliot is sealed with a kiss (well, two kisses alltogether to be exact), amidst an almost applauding crowd of approving and totally understanding teenagers at a prom.... Highly unlikely, to say the least.....All the kids act well, but the story sucks..... The one who I liked the most is actually Daniel Zolghardi as Dell, Alex's best friend with the guts to express all he feels without social fears."", 'I don\'t usually make reviews. But some people need to get this in their head. It is not a ""gay movie"". It\'s not a movie ""for"" LGBT people. It\'s a movie about an insecure, closeted teenager in denial who figures his shit out in full awkwardness. If anything, it is destined to general / straight public. It\'s not about ""being gay"". It is centered around insecurity about sexuality and questioning / denying. It\'s not homophobic. The friend wants to reassure him. He means to explain how there are all sorts of orientation, romantic and sexual, all sorts of gender, and it\'s okay, you don\'t need to have it all figured out, it\'s okay to be whatever. It\'s okay if you don\'t get it. He sees his friend all freak out and hes like ""hey, don\'t jump on your high horses, it can be anything/nothing and it\'s okay. Don\'t freak out and let things happen."" Which is okay. Also, any LGBT person will face this kind of reactions/person and it\'s not homophobic or anything.hes just not making a big deal out of it because why should he?. It\'s a big deal for the one living through it, but it\'s not for the others and that\'s all right. Also, I like how the movie is not saying ""hey, your boyfriend is gay, blame him and hate him all you can"". You may call it unrealistic, I call it realistuc. Some people react well and truly wish for the other to be happy. It happens and it\'s good to finally see something not fully stereotyped. She\'s happy for him. She wishes him good because she cares for him. She\'s not being selfish and blaming him for something he was already feeling really had about . And that\'s perfect.Anyways. Good movie. Some lengths at some points, could have done wiyouwi the puke scene because it\'s really not my pallet of fun and we have already seen those scenes in about 5/6 of all the movies that came out in the past 10 year.']",/posters/xAlex.jpg

For the viewers:\nIf you loved the book. Stay far away from that movie. Never ever watch it. \nYou will only scream in frustration, like I did. \nIf you have not read the book and you have 2.5 hrs and the money to spare, you can watch it. Maybe you will enjoy it.\nBut as many others wrote, it is a straight forward plot, cheesy scenes, mediocre story, lame jokes. I don\'t know how they kept Ernest Cline quiet. It must have either involved a lot of money or threatening him to sue. How else would you silently watch how your hard work gets so destroyed.', ""I just had my intelligence insulted for a blistering 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't know who this movie is for, but it's not for fans of the book. It's a beautiful movie that ruins itself with horrible pacing and non-existent character development.My favorite part is at the end when they casually collapse the world economy two times a week because Spielberg's kids need a life lesson on putting their cell phones down."", ""I'm sad now, they really could've made something great that could've appealed to all generations...those who lived thru the 80s and millenials with the technology. Should've followed their book closer, should've been a trilogy. I mean duh! There are 3 main sections of the book!!! So many missed opportunities and so much content missing. The only thing I gained from this were the visuals of characters and surrounds so I can re-read the book and forget about this mess.""]",/posters/xReady.jpg

If you're 10 years old or younger, maybe.I honestly am shocked by all the positive reviews and high rotten tomatoes score. Did I see a completely different movie? IT starts off very well with a genuinely good opening scene. Great cinematography, atmosphere, lighting, a likable child whom you connect with easily, and an interesting encounter takes place between this kid and a very creepy clown. The dialogue is good, there is an eerie sense of dread, and a moment where IT aka Pennywise goes from being a friendly-ish clown to a terrifying villain in an instant through a very well placed awkward stare. It was a moment I wasn't expecting and gave me hope for the rest of the film, then... It's all downhill from there, after an almost laughable use of CG. This movie has big issues. IT isn't scary. IT's story is weak, if you can even call it a story. IT has too many underdeveloped characters. And IT is a counterproductive villain with no concrete rules for what IT can or can not do.The overuse of CG ruined any sense of tension or fear and Pennywise's tactics didn't make sense. If he feeds off fear, why reveal himself to each of the kids within a close time period? Why not concentrate on each child individually, causing far more mental torment and making them an easier kill? Pennywise also just randomly manifests himself anywhere at anytime, and disappears randomly. I don't find it scary when the antagonist manifests itself, attacks a character and right before doing damage IT vanishes..The story is a mess and there are far too many characters. I swear the first 40 minutes is the longest montage in film history. A montage of each child's development and exposure to Pennywise. It was predictable and monotonous. As for the story, I don't know what to say, besides there really isn't one. Character motivations are weak, Bill is the only one who makes sense. Where were the parents at? Not a single parent seemed to care about their missing children. The few on screen parents there were, came off as caricatures. And there were a few scenes that felt completely pointless within context of the story. The school bully and his dad, being the oddest.So in closing, IT is an uneven movie or more accurately a collection of scenes that don't flow well in a tangible story. There are some good laughs, and a few entertaining scenes. But all in all it's just an average movie. Which should've been an evident sign, when the original attached director Cary Fukunaga jumped ship."", 'I think the film was good, but didn\'t really live up to expectations. I didn\'t find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That\'s for sure. And I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I think that\'s a big reason why I just wasn\'t very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the characters fell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly when they\'ve already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all ""isn\'t real"" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going ""Come here"". I mean, really? You\'re going to fall for that? I think what does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good job with Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. But those were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun not intended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher (who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were the standouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (who played Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. Finn Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be the jokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I just wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You\'re supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been really good. I just think they spent too much focus on ""shock value"" rather than building on an atmosphere.', 'It has become ritual for me to read the novel ""It"" once a year every year since it was released in 1986. The story is more than a gore-fest, it\'s a story about love and hope and friendship that is still meaningful to me to this day.The only thing this movie has in common with the beloved book, is its name and the characters names. IT is a literal disaster and a slap in the face to anyone who actually read and cherishes the book. There are NO character backstories, nor character development at all. You are literally thrust into the movie expecting to know everything about everyone and why they are the way they are. IE: Henry Bowers and why he hates the ""Losers Club"" - He LITERALLY starts the movie trying to kill them. This is sad, because a large portion of the novel was meticulously spent doing quite the opposite and made you relate to and fall in love with the characters.Editing? What editing? This is the worst edited movie I\'ve ever seen in my life and I\'ve seen a lot in 41 years. It was literally like the film makers shot 100 scenes, put the film in a hat, and took out said scenes and spliced them together at total random. I can\'t describe it any other way than saying, at one point, one of the characters (I can\'t tell who, because they all share the EXACT same personality) says, ""I banged your mom last night"", or something similar, and before the audience can even react, the scene changes to a jump scare happening in ANOTHER PART OF TOWN INSTANTLY and with no rhyme or reason. You don\'t have time to laugh at jokes, because they aren\'t funny (unlike Stephen King\'s jokes in the book) - and you don\'t have time to be scared, because you\'re still trying to process the dick joke that was still being told when the scene abruptly ended.While the filming location for the town of Derry was suitable, having the movie take place in the 1980\'s instead of the 1950\'s JUST TO APPEASE the ""Stranger Things"" crowd was simply a terrible decision. The 1950\'s were a totally different time, and much of the characters\' reasoning and mannerisms that you need to make this movie work are lost to a time and cultural difference. These guys call themselves ""THE LOSERS SQUAD"" in this movie for god\'s sake! Kids didn\'t start calling themselves a ""squad"" until the 1980\'s (IE ""The Monster Squad) So, you love the book like me and are still reading? Thank you! Now let me list just SOME things that we both LOVE about the book that you will NOT find anywhere in this movie: The Deadlights, The Ritual of CHUD, The Mummy and the bridge, The Loser\'s Club Dam in the Barrens, the moving picture book (now its a slide machine), The Smokehouse, ""This is battery acid"", The Werewolf, Making the silver bullet after a game of monopoly, The stand pipe, Bower\'s hair turning white, ""beep beep Richie"", the giant bird, the 50\'s racism against Mike (actually Mike Hanlon himself is missing. The writers just made arguably the most important character an afterthought in this movie), character backstories, ""Hi Ho Silver-AWAY!"", Haystack... I could go on and on and on.With god awful editing, absolutely no character backstories, cheap teen jump scares, not being faithful to the book, and too much CGI usage: Simply put - if you want to know how this movie is like the book, read the first 10 pages of ""IT"", and burn the other 1077 pages because that is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortion.', 'The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much more than those who are. That being said, I don\'t think it is possible to make a satisfying adaption of ""It"" without doing it the Game of Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel\'s parts to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told on paper. So I guess I\'ll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They\'ve managed to portray the losers and the relationship between them decently enough- considering the running time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again - running time. They had to.That they\'ve changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad choice, and so are the other changes. They\'re creating scenes that aren\'t in the book. They\'re changing things that are there. The biggest problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It just isn\'t terrifying. At all.I didn\'t find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn\'t a good adaptation.', 'I\'ll start this review by addressing that I had no expectation for the movie. I am not a fan of the horror genre as it usually lacks the thought provoking aspects I look forward to in film, but the reviews were great and I thought I\'d give it a shot.The films antagonist is a demon-clown, who can shape-shift and move through space in an instant as demonstrated during the film. IT abducts, kills and eats children, but can only do so if they are experiencing fear. In the finale fight scene of the movie Pennywise is unable to kill and eat Beverly because she is not afraid of IT but at the start of the movie he kills Georgie after having a 5 minutes conversation with him where they laugh and mingle, Georgie even reaches towards IT to grab his boat - Would he really be so scared of IT at that point or was Beverly so not scared of an actual demon holding her up by the neck?The films plot surrounds around a bunch of disasters that the kids find out seem to happen every 27 years. this information is found out by a 13 year old kid named Ben, and he figured this out by reading some articles in a library. So this entire town of people has not been able to figure this out? And he informs the rest of the gang that in Derry there are substantially more children going missing than anywhere else in the US - If that is the case who is doing the abducting of children when Pennywise is on ITs break?All of the disasters have happened near sewage drains, that\'s how the kids are able to figure out where IT lives, but at one point of the movie how was Pennywise able to appear in places that have no actual relation to the sewage? Pennywise appears and disappears in Bills garage and basement, Beverlys bathroom, in a building where Mikes parents died and in Stanleys dads office. If IT can appear anywhere why does he choose to murder and abduct near the drain if ITs only purpose is to feed upon the children as demonstrated in the final act of the film, he is willing to make a deal with the gang to keep Bill and let the rest of the children go as after eating Bill he would start his 27 year break again. Why would a killer demon clown not be willing to let these kids go anyways and just hunt the other kids in town to feed as these kids are obviously trying to kill him?Pennywise seems to have unfathomable power as in a scene IT is using hair from Beverlys sink to grab and pull her but in the final scene IT is having a fist fight with a bunch of children, couldn\'t IT control some sort of object found in the sewer instead to do the same? Why is IT choosing to not use ITs full power against people who are fighting back but use such powerful methods when just trying to scare somebody?The movie is riddled with cliche\'s about the bully having a really strict father, the plot point that the only way they can defeat the evil all-powerful shape-shifting demigod of a clown is to stick together and get over their fears! and of course the scene where the boys find Beverly levitating in mid-air while she is in a complete state of trance - a coma, and what brings her out of this is a kiss on the lips from one of the boys. before the movie ends Beverly is talking about this moment saying ""It was like being dead"" but when she comes out of her coma she without taking a breath starts quoting the poem one of the boys had sent her.The movie takes place during the three months of summer and ends with the start of September where the kids still look bruised and battered from their fight. So it\'s safe to assume it must have been like a week since it happened. What were the kids doing the rest of the summer as they started seeing the clown as soon as school was out? Were they just having terrifying hallucinations of a killer clown and then enjoying the rest of their summer at the beach before going out and hunting it down? The times-pan of events in the movie don\'t seem to reflect the time it actually took to accomplish them.This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of the cinema during a movie.', 'What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the world has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience, looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting. Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to this level of candy coated perversity. What a shame.', ""I already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense CGI in the trailers. I felt super conflicted with this movie because the acting was amazing by the entire cast, however there was way too much 'comic relief'. This is a horror movie. I wanted to feel terrified because I was stuck in terror just about the whole movie. I should have left the theater sore because of being too tense. This did not happen at all. There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt like this and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it (no pun intended). The clown was so clichÃ© when it comes to cheap horror movie antics of the 2,000's. It has the retractable teeth like every new zombie movie since the Umbrella Corporation and It moves all jumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since The Ring. Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren't in a wheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place of Penny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP. The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushed through the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesy and AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have ever done. It felt like this movie had SO much potential but it was all thrown away because they were too afraid to make it 'actually scary'. Those of you who are REAL horror movie fans, you WILL be disappointed. This should have been a 'straight to Netflix' movie as far as I'm concerned and I wish I could have gotten at least 1/2 of my money back"", 'There just isn\'t the heart that was there in the mini series. In my opinion. The actors were fine, but the story wasn\'t there. I believe there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I\'ll probably watch it - if I\'ve nothing better to do. It\'s simply not Steven King\'s ""IT\'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from \' Mama\' at one point : can\'t find it now, but look out for it. ""Beep,beep, Richie"" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it\'s another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood mob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not a patch on the original. I hope to goodness they don\'t remake The Stand.\'', 'Wow, I honestly can\'t believe these reviews. I made an IMDb account just to write a review. I love the original and have seen it many times. This movie was horrible! I feel insulted by the directors. It wasn\'t scary at all. Any potential ""scary"" scene was downplayed by jokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, major holes in the story line as well. Hole 1: the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddy missing.Hole 2: the girl is pulled down from ""floating"" and brought back to life. Doesn\'t that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down from floating at the end come back to life too? Or do their rotting corpses fill up the sewers for 27 years? Does Georgie come back to life too?Hole 3: the girl can\'t decide which boy she loves. She took the poem from the pudgy kids room (I have to assume because she randomly ends up with it in her bedroom) but then she thinks that Bill wrote the poem somehow. The pudgy kid kisses her, bringing her back to life (true love brings back the dead girl like Princess & the Frog or something) but she winds up with Bill. Every cheesy, horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film. The acting was good, but I can\'t see how this is touted as a horror film. I felt like I was watching a Disney movie by the end of it.', 'I don\'t even know what to say. There was so much wasted potential here. I will say that the cinematography, the location, and the children (The Losers Club) hold up really well for this film. Yet, I\'m still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I\'m still shaking my head. Here is the one thing for me, that ruined the movie. If you don\'t want any spoilers I suggest you stop reading. Here goes..What is going on with all the CGI in this film? Computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects. I had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film ""Mama"" Anytime something was seemingly scary, or anytime I thought ""Hey, this movie might redeem itself"" it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary. The human eye is easy to detect how fake CGI can be and folks, let me tell you, this movie relies INCREDIBLY HEAVILY on computer animated effects. No incredible monster movie effects from the 80s here. The sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the 80s (instead of the 50s like the book). What better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural, realistic, and horrifying movie effects? The 70s had The Exorcist. Top notch REAL effects. Do you remember The Thing from the 1980s? ThHOSE PRACTICAL EFFECTS STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY. Its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares. Anyway, I\'m rambling...For all of you fans of the book out there.. Spoiler alert again..You WILL be disappointed. It only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here. There is no Ritual of Chud. There is no Mummy, Werewolf, or drowned children in the Standpipe. Everything is rushed. This film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so. If you haven\'t read the book, maybe you\'ll have a decent time if you can handle CGI. I for one thought IT was extremely disappointing, confusing, and ultimately boring and clichÃ©. God, I wish this could have gone a different way.If you are truly interested in seeing IT... Please...please.... Save your money and go see something else. Or at the very least, wait to rent it.', 'IT was...meh. I am sure part of my problem with this movie is that I am such a King addict, and IT is one of my favorites. The book had some problems, for sure, and the movie did a couple of things that I thought were an improvement. But for the most part, this new movie wasn\'t a wonderful story about friendships and grief and terror and strength and survival, which made the book so good and memorable. It was just a horror movie with little character development, and cheap tricks. And that was a major disappointmentSpecific problems I had:1) There was NO reason to change it from 1958 to 1985, other than to capitalize on Stranger Things. IT lost a lot with that change. The 1980\'s were far less innocent. Some of the stuff from the 50\'s just didn\'t translate to what kids would do in the 80\'s (paper boats with parafin wax??? What house had parafin in the 80\'s?) And with that loss of innocence it makes far less sense that the kids would even see IT in all its guises. The whole point is that only small children who are still basically afraid of the boogeyman can even see him.2) Tying in with that--the kids were aged from 11ish to 14ish. Kids just finishing fifth grade? Yes, you can believe they\'d still be afraid of scary clowns, mummies and lepers. Kids who just finished their first year of high school? In the 80\'s? No. (Somebody said they weren\'t in high school--check Ben\'s yearbook. And classmate-- Henry\'s friend is driving.)3) This Pennywise was almost too dark. Yes, he\'s a monster, but there\'s also this manic charm that he can use to lure kids. Skaarsgard is very good, but he\'s just terrifying. Little kids would be scared to death of him; they\'d run away from him on sight, not be kinda interested. Tim Curry handled that brilliantly.4) The casting of the kids was atrocious! Bev and Mike look like they\'re 17. Eddie looks 10. They do not in any way look like contemporaries. Bev was far too mature for the sweet romance to work and Mike was big enough to beat Henry up himself. Also, his backstory was just so weird with his parents being dead and the sheep killing. He didn\'t work at all, and he was such an important character--the lightkeeper.5) They cut a lot of the kids\' backstories and connection/friendship moments in favor of cheap thrills. And the special effects went the ""jerky"" horror movie route and looked really fake and dumb for a big-budget movie.6) I hated what they did to Stanley\'s character. You won\'t have much empathy for him for the choice he makes as an adult because he\'s so unlikable as a kid.7) Why on earth would the entrance to the sewers be underneath the Niebolt Street house? Just because the filmmakers needed a shortcut to include the spooky house? (Oy and talk about cheesy CGI--that house looked like a graphic you\'d use in a Halloween party invitation!) And the way the kids acted in the house--getting separated twice--was just such lazy writing and was really dumb. (But the clown room was wicked cool!)8) OMG they cut Eddie\'s most important line?! (battery acid) Does that mean adult Eddie doesn\'t get to reprise that moment?Okay, there were a couple of things I really DID like:The scenes with Bev and her father were horrifying and so tense I was clenching my fists. He was the most terrifying monster in the film.The ""floating"" (we all float) was finally done in a way that looked amazing and made the repeated threat make perfect sense.All the actors were very good! I just didn\'t like the choices the writers/directors made with them.Out of curiosity, I did just rewatch the IT miniseries. Yes, it\'s very dated. The soundtrack isn\'t great, the graphics are very miniseries-ish, and the special effects are laughable. And the adult portions were just okay--TV actors reunion. Yes, they were fine, but not standouts.The kids, however, were standouts, and all the kids\' sections were really good. Really good actors, amazing chemistry, age and era appropriate, they all looked the parts, looked the same age. Really, everything about the kids parts of the miniseries was superior to the new film if you look at it as just a really solid movie and not a ""horror flick."" It didn\'t have the scares, but it had the story, and the heart. It\'s very possible the IT-2, adult part will be better. But despite its age, its cheesiness and its eye-rolling special effects, I think the 1st half of the miniseries was superior to the new movie.', 'It really is ridiculous how this movie is being praised like crazy.  This movie is so fvcking generic. It wasn\'t scary nor was it funny.  Just stupid.  This movie is FULL of jump scares. That\'s literally all the movie does  in attempt to ""scare"" the audience. It\'s the cheapest and laziest way  to ""scare"" people. Many times the kids in this movie try to be funny  but come off really stupid instead.  The scene where the two groups of kids are throwing rocks at each other  and the movie is playing some rock music is so cringy. What the Hell  was the point of that scene? Ridiculous.  And what was up with that zombie homeless looking dude? That zombie guy  talks like a death metal singer and I felt like I was watching The  Walking Dead.  I did not give a fat fvck about ANY of the kids in this movie. I was  not interested nor was I rooting for the kids. There was nothing  special about any of the kid characters. NONE of the kids of the  ""Losers Club"" gets killed in this film. All that tension and none of  the kids get killed. Not one.   Close to the end of the film, Pennywise gets his ass beat by a group of  kids with baseball bats and chains. LOL! He couldn\'t fight them back.  Stupid movie.', '*Spoliers*Honestly I was really excited about this movie, like really excited. I watched the original IT this morning to get ready for it and have some reference. And it was absolutely terrible. Seriously, TERRIBLE. Not only did I want to walk out the second Pennywise was shown in the beginning but the rest was torture. I was with other people so I couldn\'t walk out. Here\'s the thing, this is the first time I\'ve ever been so disappointed with a movie that I went out of my way to write a review about it. The clown was not scary in the slightest. The teeth were stupid. The acting was a joke. The kids made a ton of terrible and sexual jokes. It didn\'t stick to the original movie whatsoever. They took the ""you\'ll float too"" a little too seriously. It just plain sucked. In the original, the kids were innocent and actually dorks but this was pathetic the way the kids were talking. And why the hell did we watch them in their underwear?!? I still keep wondering how the hell this movie is rated above an 8 when it should be a disappointment for anyone who knows what a good movie is. This was so much CGI that it took away from the whole movie. I could keep going but I think I\'ve made my point. I wouldn\'t waste your time or money. Watch the trailer and that\'s as good as it gets. Ugh.', 'I\'m a huge fan of the 1990\'s TV film of ""It"", especially for its aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of 12. This remake, or perhaps actually a ""re-adaptation"", is certainly very timely, what with ""Stranger Things"" becoming so huge with pretentious hipsters everywhere. I\'m still not sure it hits the ""scary"" factor very well, especially without Tim Curry\'s tremendous acting, but it\'s certainly creepy. It\'s not nostalgic though, nor does it retain much of the original novel, including the 50\'s setting, changed to the 80\'s to obviously market itself with ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Goonies"".My problem with this new adaptation of ""It"" is that it\'s addled with CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you\'re trying to make a film set decades before this era, you don\'t use CGI at all if you can avoid it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of being edgy. Yes, the book had profanity, but King knew where to draw the line and keep the perfect balance of immature vulgarity and true friendship. The sheer level of nerdiness here made me cringe, unlike the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love and joy amidst the horror, just like King\'s novel. Did one of those boys seriously just say ""Get me my bifocals, I hid them in my second fanny pack""? What the hell kind of child wears bifocals? Why not just rename him Poindexter while they\'re at it? The kids in the book and the miniseries were never this obnoxiously dorky. And what\'s with all this New Kids on the Block stuff? There was a scene in which for no apparent reason all these close-ups of NKOTB posters pop up on-screen. Why? Just because earlier in the film a kid had been listening to that music? It made no sense! We get loads of terrible one liners from Richie comparing the blood in the sewers to ""period blood"" (lovely, eh?) and trust me, no way does any thirteen-year-old talk like this. All kids at that age swear and tell fart jokes and stuff, but even they have their limits.Mike is only added as an afterthought, which seems borderline offensive, as if they only added him as a token minority whereas in the book and film he was such a complex, central character. He had a strong bond with his father that\'s totally absent from this film. Stan is unlikable, and the newly revamped Pennywise the Clown has teeth that could rival the most inbred hillbilly, and the most scary thing he seems to be able to do is hop around like some kind of wino. Uh yeah, real ""spooky"", I\'m shaking in my boots. Then we have the film\'s complete disregard for the friendship, the glue that holds the story together. Killing and gore and sex and violence and swearing is not what horror is about, it\'s about the darker side of life, and this film only portrays it in a cheesy slasher film type of way. I\'m not trying to sound preachy, but where\'s the love and friendship between the characters? When it is there (which isn\'t very often) it feels forced. In the old miniseries, it felt authentic and true, and the kids were actually portrayed as kids, not young adults. This new film is completely void of the book\'s special qualities such as the ""hi-ho Silver!"" thing and Eddie\'s ""battery acid"" line. The film just doesn\'t have the stunning scenery that the miniseries had, either. The miniseries had an actual gothic revival pump house as the sewer building (the Buntzen Hydroelectric Station of British Columbia), and it was creepy and nostalgic and absolutely the perfect choice. It had nailed down the industrial small town in an economic slump kind of look perfectly, too. This film looks too clean for that, with CGI used in all the wrong places to create what looks like fake looking stage sets.This film isn\'t completely terrible. It passes the time, but the only thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some 80\'s vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video game full of childish jump scares. I was hoping it might be more like the 2012 film Sinister, a genuinely frightening and timeless boogeyman that leaves a subtle unsettling presence wherever it goes, but no, it just looked cheap and lazy, an obvious cash grab that\'s being WAY overhyped. A 7.5/10 rating, are you kidding me? Even King\'s 1995 notoriously bad film The Mangler was better than this! It\'s like with good marketing, this new film was able to pull the wool over everybody\'s eyes and fool them into thinking it was a classic masterpiece.', 'First I wanna say great family movie, bring the kids... So they can laugh along with you, I don\'t want to spoil the immense amount of nothing that happens in this movie, or how you\'ll grow bored of waiting for ""it"" to get scary, but I do want to know how much they were paying people walking into the screenings giving this movie a 10 star rating, or how large is the pr team? I laugh when I see red balloons now. Thought I was going to see a horror movie, got a comedy.. Talk about a let down.', ""I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologically tormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years to get over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers made me concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that you stop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positive reviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had me optimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go see it. Unfortunately, I can't do that after seeing IT.The first 10 minutes of the film were perfect. Ultimately what I was most looking forward to from IT was a new take on Pennywise. I wanted to see what a different actor could do with him, particularly his ability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing. And I felt like I got that in the first scene, and that was pretty much it. After the Georgie scene it seemed like anything SkarsgÃ¥rd did was masked by CGI, overblown audio, and distracting cinematography in 80-90% of his remaining screen time. What's sad is I think the mainstream audience will still eat this style up. The same people who will call this Pennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the Star Wars prequels were better because they had more LIGHT SABERS in them. OK.Sure, I enjoyed the crude Richie and Eddie humor, and thought it was well-cast for the most part. But by the end I was almost yawning through the Pennywise scenes. I just got out of the film and am alone in a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest. There is something wrong with that."", 'I am very surprised that this film got such a high ranking. I enjoy the books, films and TV shows of Stephen King but found that this film fell way too short. The trailer looks great and Pennywise the clown looks terrifying so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but after watching this film which is over 2 hours long I could not wait for it to finish,I was waiting for it to get better but it does not - there was no scare factor whatsoever I just found it a bit boring and such a let down. I really feel this should have just gone straight to DVD - way over hyped.', ""I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane. The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd has taken Pennywise and made the role his own. Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT really possess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. The entire casting choices were sensational. All actors really held their own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters. Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to my heart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantly surprised. So much so that upon IT being released into cinemas, I'll be back in line to see it again."", ""The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric, and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief moment where while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goes quiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly, that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of the film is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like the deriative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoon Netflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to the story, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless and drifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film. Its OK - but it really isn't the classic that people are making out to be. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to be a far more effective supernatural chiller."", ""This contains spoilers.I am definitely no film critic but I do love horror films. 'IT' was not a horror film.I may as well have been watching The Goonies/Stand By Me/Stranger Things. Certain songs in the soundtrack really did not fit the scenes. The Score was just WAY TOO MAGICAL for a horror movie. Scenes would have benefited from no music at all i.e. Father/Daughter scene in the house. This would have given the movie a gripping sense of realism which I just could not find ANYWHERE.I could not get attached to the characters in this film as they just kept attaching themselves to the party like leeches. How many characters are there in the end? 7 or 8? Way too many. The acting was okay. The kid with the glasses didn't really fit the 'Obnoxious bad boy' role and ended up just being annoying where the chubby kid looked literally 3 years younger than the main girl...They were meant to be in the same class weren't they? The main bully was probably the scariest character in the entire film including the clown but I will get to that in a minute. The main bully was literally a psychopath! Who is not scared of a psychopath? I mean, the part where he used the switchblade to carve his name into the chubby kids stomach and the chase scene which ensues was a highlight of the 'horror' film. This was one of the more realistic scenes. It's way over the top, but was one of the very few sadistic horror aspects of this film. The kids were also way too brave and ultimately very quickly ended up not being afraid of the clown at all.I'll keep it short and sharp with the clown. It's voice was not even the least bit scary throughout the film. Yes there were semi unnerving scenes, i.e. the drain scene at the start where the clown was talking to the boy. This was more of what I wanted to see as a horror fan, it's creepy demeanor and sick tendencies/intentions though speech alone. However this was then followed by a ridiculous scene where it shows a bunch of razor sharp teeth and proceeds to bite the boys hand then cutting to the whole arm missing. Really?I often caught myself throwing my hands up in the air in disbelief and thinking to myself, How did this get classed as a horror movie.We ended up walking out early as we just couldn't take it anymore. 'IT' WAS Awful."", ""Nothing. This was a staggeringly ham-fisted approach to either King's novel or the miniseries based on it. It missed the point utterly... You will not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them to overcome a monster. You will see a load of bickering kids who seem to barely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue the kidnapped object of their pre-teen lust. You will not see an intelligently-written story. You will see a dumbed-down, by-the-numbers screenplay, complete with the usual beats, Crisis of Faith, Catharsis, and all. You will not see belief overpowering evil. You will see a ten-minute fight scene where every kid tries to out-cool every other kid and get off a Schwarzeneggerian one-liner.This movie is garbage. I can't express it more eloquently than that."", 'If you\'ve ever seen the original, and you have even the slightest modicum of respect for originality, story telling and artistic integrity, this movie should infuriate you. Firstly, it isn\'t really a movie. There is no story. It\'s basically just a 2 hour collection of different sorts of scares. The brilliance with the original was that it was a story of kids torn apart by a traumatic event, and then brought back together as adults to face their fears and avenge their friend. Great story. But this version was essentially a haunted house on the screen. They abandoned the kid to adult story and just focused on a group of kids getting scared. There was way too much ""comedy"" being sprinkled throughout. You know, the lame kind where the characters make some unoriginal comment and everyone in the movie theater bursts out laughing like Dave Chappelle just hit his stride on stage. And the random love stories among the kids that didn\'t matter or further any narrative. I could write a 10,000 word essay going into the depths of all that is wrong with this movie so I\'ll stop. The worst of all is watching all of America fall in love with this. It makes me feel like a cynical jerk, but I think really it\'s just a clear sign of the dumbing down of people on this earth. No one respects or cares about great storytelling anymore. Just give them cheap pop-up scares and they will be happy. It really is sad.']",/posters/xItÂ (2017).jpg

Disappointing is probably an understatement. This movie is a disaster. Not only is the acting incredibly awful, especially from some otherwise accomplished cast members, but the original storyline was all but abandoned. I read the book several times, and even I was confused what was going on in this film. There was no explanation for any of the concepts, character development was nonexistent, special effects were plentiful but meaningless. The most fascinating parts of the book were eliminated, or only presented so quickly that it was difficult to understand why they were happening and how they related to the story. This movie could have been SO great - there was incredible potential here, and Disney and the director literally wasted it all.', 'I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys flying lettuce, terrible acting, giant Oprah in a mermaid costume, or awful confusing plots with terrible direction. Disney - as someone who had to sit through this film I respectfully request that you use your Marvel money to build a time machine and give 2 hours back to any audience forced to see this abomination.', 'I very rarely walk out in the middle of a movie. But I did last night about one hour into ""Wrinkle In Time""--and I was glad I did. This film had everything wrong with it, direction, acting, scripting. About the only aspect I found somewhat rewarding was the special effects, which kept me in my seat for at least those 60 excruciating minutes.\nAva DuVernay\'s direction bordered on amateurish. Her framing was uncomfortably tight in a number of shots. And I\'ve seen more of Oprah\'s inside of her nose with DuVernay\'s camera looking up at the giant actress than I care to remember.\nThe pouting Storm Reid, playing the 13-year-old Meg Murry, was unrelatable as the heroine of the film. And most irritating was her younger brother, Deric McCabe, whose high-pitched voice was barely intelligible. \nWalt Disney Pictures should be ashamed of themselves releasing this complete waste of time. I\'ve seen film school studio projects better produced than this. I hope the paying public avoids this film and sends this film quickly into the trash dump.', 'I was excited to watch this movie. High expectations based on all the marketing given to it. It ended up being extremely boring, too slow. No action or great parts at all. The story starts and develops so slow and with nothing exciting to tell. There were moments (if not the entire movie) in which all the magic could be seen as fake and special effect only. The acting for the main character is bad. Very bad. I could tell it was too acted. Really, sad too see such a beautiful story brought too life to become so boring and say nothing at the end of it all.', ""This is probably the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. It's also probably the worst movie I've seen this year. The movie for starters is flat out BORING. The majority of the film is people standing around talking, and they aren't talking about anything interesting or that advances the plot in most cases. There's some beautiful imagery here, but then there's also too much green screen and CGI going on that it just loses it's luster. What is the deal with this director also? There were probably 70+ shots inches away from each actors face. It didn't look pretty and was extremely distracting to me. Somehow this director had all of these great actors and couldn't even get anything out of the majority of them. Chris Pine was about the only person that did a good job here. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's unbelievable that this is a film with a budget over $100 million. They should have never even released this travesty."", 'I was speechless after the credits started rolling. The women next to me asked what I thought. I told them some of the crucial, pivotal aspects they had so obviously left out of the film version by choice. It was a fatal mistake and I believe they did it for reasons that directly contradict L\'Engle\'s reason for writing the book in the first place. ""Sounds like we should go read the book."" That was the best message I could offer to anyone else who wants to know about the movie. Forget it. Go read the book. The movie is a hundred-million-dollar backstreet rape, bereft of all magic or joy. This film was made by the creatures of Camazotz and offered at the altar of IT.. \nSuch a shame. I really was looking forward to this one. What we got is smply dreadful.', 'Great actors with very poor script. Rendering poor performance. Even my 10 yr old daughter was bored and wanted to leave early. \nWe wondered why we were the only ones in the theatre. \nA real disappointment', 'I had been looking forward to this movie because the trailers made it look like it had potential to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately it lived up to none of that potential. Horrendous acting, insultingly cheesy special effects, confusing directing, and a clumsily written screenplay made for a punitive moviegoing experience. My nephew was bored five minutes in, and I was cringing. I am shocked that Disney released this in theaters. They usually have more respect for their customers.', ""This movie has nothing to do with the books I enjoyed as a child. In fact it was so poorly adapted that to even call it A Wrinkle in Time is an insult to the original book. If only I could fold time and go backwards to get my 2 hours back and the $$ it cost!! Save your money and your time it's not even worth renting!"", ""What a trainwreck, terrible acting, preachy storyline and a poor adaptation of a decent children's story. Recommend this movie to your worst enemy, if revenge is your game."", 'A Wrinkle In Time is a boring and cheaply done plot, taking all the liberties of Disney-style writing and turning it into slop. Not only does it smash its original source material, but it feels more like a dumbed-down version of it. It has a bad plot with loose ends, one-dimensional characters and really choppy acting. Watch Tomb Raider instead, because at least THAT movie respects its source material. This movie is just a one big backwards step for Disney.', ""There seems to be a decent story somewhere in this message. But I couldn't make it far enough in. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Now I'm just sitting in the parking lot, writing a review while I wait for my wife and kids to exit the movie in about an hour."", 'I didn\'t even want to see this to begin with. But I was dragged by people who only wanted to see if because Reese Witherspoon is in it. So to begin with.. the plot is not good. There hardly even is one. The special effects were mediocre but not horrible.. the characters were two dimensional and you can\'t really connect to them. I don\'t even understand the point of Calvinother than Meg\'s love interest. But WHY DOES SHE NEED A LOVE INTEREST. She is a child and while she may have a crush, there is no need for there to be a romantic storyline within this movie. Charles Wallace mentioned that he cane along for diplomacy, but where do we even see that come into play? Meg is just dragging him along the whole time. And on that topic, how does Charles Wallace know all of this stuff. Sure, he\'s a smart kid, but are we supposed to believe he\'s psychic or something? And he can just summon the universe? Also, why is the universe so concerned with them? Don\'t they have other things to spend their time on? So anyways.. the three Mrs show up and oprah\'s Character is like 20ft taller than everyone else.. why? Because she\'s oprah, that\'s why... and that cheapens the feel of the movie. We get it.. you\'re Oprah. So then they go to this magical land and find out what direction her dad went. So the Reese Witherspoon changes into some giant flying creature so they can go look for their father. But the director focused on the magic of flying and the fun of it that we lost the point of even being up there. There was literally no point to that entire scene other than to put in some ""cool"" special effects. They saw ""the darkness"" though. It\'s supposedly ""pure evil."" How pure of an evil can it really be in a PG Disney movie... huh? Anyways, they meet Zach galifinakis to help find their father. (Also, why wouldn\'t the Mrs be able to find him or help meg find him if they are literally the universe with a bunch of magical powers??) anywho.. galifinakis shows a vision of her dad discovering love is the frequency needed in order to terrasect. (If that\'s the case, how do people NOT terrasect). And that he went into the darkness. So suddenly the darkness is it\'s own planet? And Meg risks the lives of THE UNIVERSE in order to go into the darkness.. because that\'s a good idea. So she gets tested by the darkness and meg is the only one who can resist it.. what happened to Charles Wallace being the all-knowing leader of the group? He falls under the spell of the darkness almost immediately. And also, why was he already across the wall? Did it not fit their ""love story"" plot to have a young(er) child intervene? So now Charles Wallace is evil and suddenly has magical powers. But again.. how evil can he be in a Disney movie? Not very.. and that makes it laughable. So meg again passes more tests and finds her father. Who hasn\'t aged a day, his beard hasn\'t grown, and has survived in a small room with nothing? What did he eat? Where did he go to the bathroom? Then all of the sudden the darkness REALLY wants meg and just meg. (Again I wonder why such a powerful being would be so interested in these specific children) and meg gets tested some more. All of this just being a lesson to teach her to love herself, to have self esteem. And that\'s the cure. That\'s what strongly weakens the darkness. Again... why does the universe (light and dark) care SO MUCH about one little girl\'s self esteem. Then the three Mrs tell meg that she\'s the next ""great person"" in line with ghandi, Marie curie, and various others. Just because she knows basic physics, can figure out a puzzle, and loves herself??? Also, another thing I forgot to mention,; Mrs who can only speak in quotes because she\'s not strong enough to speak her own thoughts. Then when they are on the darkness\' planet, she speaks her own words and oprah explains that it\'s because the planet is making her weak.... so how does that make sense????? Anyways. It was a horrible movie with tons of plot holes and a really bad plot line. The director focused more on the special affects and costumes than she did on a script, plot, or acting. But hey.. oprah is in it.', ""After seeing all the hype by Disney I was looking forward to seeing the movie. It didn't take long for me to wonder why I was still sitting there.

I am not sure....AHAHAH"" throughout the movie; the little boy who acted Charles Wallace was fine but overacting for the most of the time; the teenage boy was just showing ""I am so conscious of my good-looking and I am seducing you"". What the heck?! More importantly, the plot is all over the place and filled with cliche. I am for girl power but this is just so cynical and use girl power as a selling point and nothing else makes sense. Witherspoon and Pine are fine but were eclipsed by this bad screenplay.

Jane Fonda plays a wealthy, cougarish hotelier; Candace Bergen plays a divorced Federal judge; Mary Steenburgen plays a married-but-under-sexed restaurateur; and Diane plays a widowed mom with two grown (and grown too overprotective) daughters. What do all four have in common? A book club that the four of them have been the sole members of since 1974. Their most recent reading material? The ""Fifty Shades"" book trilogy by E.L. James.

Assuming, of course, one is not some Millenial age-ist.In short; I wish I could quote some of the more memorable lines that made me belly laugh.

Other than that there is nothing good about this movie. One of the worst sequels in history.', 'I very much enjoyed the original movie and so was looking forward to seeing this. I watch about 30 minutes before I just stopped. Plot jumps all over the place and there is zero flow to the movie. You have no interest in the characters and the whole feel is just hollow and pointless.Do yourself a favor and spend the 30 minutes I wasted doing something else.', ""Let's be brief. All of the fighting / action scenes are shaky cam nonsense. 95% of the dialogue is expositional. The direction seems very basic. This feels and looks more like an episode of an American broadcast network crime drama television program, than film.\nI didn't go in expecting anything and I was left with less."", ""What an awful movie this is, I cannot believe this movie hits the theaters. It is clearly a B-movie, very cheap CGI, the acting is poor and the story? Take a stack of cards, throw it in the air, there's your story. I knew this movie would suck but I did not expect it would be that bad. It is full with plot holes, if you see this movie, question marks will be floating above your head during the whole movie. A lot of viewers will leave their seats and some might ask their money back."", 'If you are thinking that - Ohh I enjoyed first part let finish the sequel.\nIts a total waste of time.', 'What a shambles of a movie. No coherence whatsoever. Just jumped from one scene to the next without any links.

Yes, it was just an excuse to team up Arnie and Sly but it was fun, well done and definitely an entertaining action movie. This one however is just atrocious. The story is weak, the villains utterly interchangeable and Stallone sleepwalks his way through it, clearly just thinking of the money. He's not even in it that much - the main character is a martial arts guy. The writers have just watched Fortress and made a weak knock-off. The CGI is staggeringly awful and if you make it to the end you'll realise with horror that they leave it open for ANOTHER sequel. Avoid like the plague."", ""I'm disappointed at the incoherent and disjointed dialogue, disgusted at the CGI, and definitely unimpressed with the plot. It could have been better, but it would be making another completely different movie."", ""This movie got leaked. And it sucks too. It's just boring."", 'Sly should have stayed content with the first movie. \nResorting to cheap production and half baked scripts for a quick buck. \nBautista was making something of himself with GOTG, he should immediately pull out of Escape Plan 3.', ""Is on Stallone's head.... For crying out loud, why would anyone create such garbage? Actually, why not? all you need is to borrow 50 thousand dollars and create a piece of s**t. The story was probably written by 8 years old relative, the director was his twin brother, the only expanse was for the 12 years old who made the CG on his pentium 3 computer, few bucks each for the homeless guys who played the prisoners, probably took 2-3 days to shoot the whole joke. One of the worst movies EVER. only send your enemies to watch it."", 'I like Stallone, a lot! He is one of my heroes. However, the first movie was bad and sadly this one is really worst. I wish IMDB allow us to rate with ""0"".', ""Stopped watching after 20 mins, you need subtitles as half the actors can't speak English, this movie must have been made for the Chinese market. The plot makes no sense and the acting is awful. I think Stallone is in the movie for about 10 mins. Give this one a miss."", 'Watch this film! It has all a bad film needs. Bad acting it looks like it came off from a student short film. From the beginning we felt really disappointed, the transitions from scene to scene was awful, though it made us feel like we were high and was suffering from all the diseases, hitting us all at once. Though I give the director kudos for best crossover film it has given us. We saw a snippet of the fast and the furious, I mean they tried so hard to squeeze in a car scene, even though it was clearly unnecessary. There was also a weird Jimmy Neutron vibe, whenever, Huang Xiaoming, the star thought of something brilliant. The prison itself made us feel like we were watching a Star Wars film, it sucked, it made me feel sleepy. The plot itself was an idiotic way to make a sequel to the first one good. I mean the movie stars off where a guy from work gets fired, and the movie suddenly takes off to a revenge story with a guy making a high-tech, advance of the art prison in one year. Stressing the point where he just did all of this just because he got fired by Sylvester Stallone. \nIn conclusion, the film is the worst film we have watched where they scenes made us laugh, and make fun of the acting of all the casts. The movie is pretty much comprised of Sylvester Stallone being an inside voice to Huang Xiaoming. But all is well in the end as we left the theater laughing and recalling all the bad acting, the movie could pass as a comedy but as an action?No...', ""I have never written a review for a movie.

In real life, Barry Seal was fired from TWA in '72 when he was charged for smuggling plastic explosives across Mexico. He flew tons of coke into the States for multiple drug kingpins, including Escobar. When he was busted, he started working for the DEA as an informant. He was overweight, poisoned his fellow Americans with drugs; and didn't care about his family enough to enter WITSEC.From a historical perspective, it should be taken with a grain of salt that a guy like Seal, given his position, can be placed in a situation where everything is cool, time after time after time after time again."", ""I have to Confess i am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but when i got a chance to go to an Advanced Press Screening of his latest movie with my Brother, who works in the press i reluctantly gave it a shot. I surely had a pleasant surprise in store, with the movie being a blast from start to finish and had a ton of retro 80's music. After the disaster that's THE MUMMY, Tom Cruise returns to form with some of his best work in the last 10 years outside the Mission Impossible franchise. Its a story based on the real life events of Barry Seal, a pilot who plays a crucial role in the Iran-Contra Affair, here we see Tom Cruise return to familiar territory where he makes us fall in love with a Semi-good guy who does bad things but we are not quite sure and root for him, because Tom Cruise makes us fall in love with him with his 1000 Watt Smile. The supporting cast was serviceable but make no mistake this is a Tom Cruise vehicle purely designed to show everyone he still has it !!!"", ""Always reliable if not exactly visionary, director Doug Liman has another entertaining outing with Tom Cruise, reinventing his charm, swagger and grin as tools for finding easy cash and marital respect when honest work doesn't exactly get one far enough.Cruise plays a totally reprehensible and despicable character and yet manages to keep everyone invested in the ride that accelerates with every misstep on the way, fully captivating the audience to wait for the extent of the looming train wreck. Cruise is entirely game here, not once trying to make audience feel sorry for his character or thinking that maybe he had a heart of gold, after all. Worth pointing out is also a stellar turn from a less prolific Domhnall Gleeson whose ambitious CIA operator is equally blind, naive and brilliant, and Gleeson makes his oily presence wonderfully effective."", 'By Terry Reed, Author of Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA. It finally happened. The complex core of my book Compromised, the CIA\'s covert guns and drugs debacle cleverly mislabeled the Iran Contra Scandal, has hit the big screen thanks to the efforts of Universal Studios, Director Doug Liman, Screen Writer Gary Spinelli, Tom Cruise and a host of professionals. Liman told me he was attracted to this project as a result of insider information he gleaned from his father Arthur Liman, Chief Counsel for the US Senate\'s investigation of the Iran Contra affair.As the person who wrote the original, first hand and definitive book on the Barry Seal/Mena, Arkansas operation, from the inside, I was the most skeptical critic the movie had to win over since I had lived much of the Mena ordeal right along side Barry Seal\x85the movie\'s main character played by Cruise.Sure, there are major deviations from the historical record of what happened in Mena, and the screenwriter exercised his dramatic license combining characters and blending together events for the purpose of cramming this sordid story into 120 minutes of educational entertainment. But that\'s Hollywood.As someone who worked with several major Hollywood production companies and screen writers (Clint Eastwood and Dennis Hackin just to drop names) who attempted to bring Compromised to the theaters, I realize how difficult it is find that balance between authenticity, entertainment, time constraints and marketability. Doug Liman has done just that! Those I worked with who attempted to whittle Compromised down to an understandable narrative were most often left with a docudrama type product that in most cases over-reflected the political bend of the whittlers. Just as the title of my book suggests, the Iran Contra scandal and the subsequent unraveling of a CIA covert operation run amuck impacts both political parties. Sure, most will argue that Hollywood is liberal and most likely to err on the side of protect-the-Democrats at all costs, but let\'s face it, the vast majority of the guns and drugs scandal imbedded within the Mena/Contra support program falls directly into Republican laps. Again, Liman did a superb job of staying true to the Mena geographical location and then suggesting strongly that then-Governor Bill Clinton had a hand in it when the US Attorney\'s efforts to apprehend Seal in Arkansas are thwarted.But alas, two hours is a short time to compress history, relay intricate information into a comprehensible story line and then ultimately deal with the life and fate of Cruise\'s character, pilot Barry Seal. Cruise for the most part is receiving accolades for his Seal portrayal, and I agree American Made underscores that occasionally Cruise can move outside of his Mission Impossible persona and reacquaint us with the depths of his talent.I must say how rewarding it is to have consulted on the movie with Doug Liman and his staff, and to see how he wove the nuances I provided into the scenes in such an authentic and unobtrusive way. The Contra training camp and mile-high-club scene are just a few of those nuggets that cause the screenplay to frequently place foot on terra firma.Debbie Seal, the real life widow of Barry who unfortunately is being forced to relive this tragic chapter of her life by watching her husband\'s demise, saw the movie in a different light. She reminded me that Barry was double-crossed by the Reagan White House which not only resulted in her husband\'s death by Pablo Escobar, but also forced her to raise their three children alone. Debbie compared it to Jacqueline Kennedy watching a movie of the JFK assassination. A grim reality check.The Mena/Iran Contra scandal resulted in many of us falling into the category of ""disposable assets"" and being falsely labeled when a covert White House back door operation ran amuck, and we became political liabilities. Much of what we suffered through was the result of cowardly behavior on behalf of the Reagan/Bush Administrations who knew full well that many of us who were recruited for this covert operation were ""left in the cold"" and disavowed when this violation of Congressional Law (The Boland Amendment) became public knowledge. Most of us were Vietnam Veterans who had skill sets needed for the operation and felt honored to be selected to become part of a CIA backed Air America style operation.This is where I do take exception to the movie plot line. Many of us, myself included, had nothing to do with the transportation of illegal narcotics into America. We were briefed on Barry Seal\'s multi-prong, multi-agency (DEA, and US Customs undercover activities penetrating the Medellin Cartel that included ""controlled deliveries"" of cocaine) operation but the vast majority of us were tasked with the difficult and dangerous work of training the Contras to build out their own guerilla warfare weapons air delivery system and delivering both munitions and humanitarian aid in a war zone. The movie had two different opportunities to move deeper in this direction, but I presume time constraints kept the plot line humming along in the direction it took.All in all it is a great first effort to bring the Iran Contra scandal to the movie theaters. It is about flawed human nature, war, life, death and the seedy behavior of politicians and the alphabet soup federal agencies that violate their own codes of ethics and policies,all in the guise of National Security.If you haven\'t seen American Made do so. But I must brief you. Fasten your seat belt, stow your tray table and get ready for an exciting, educational and turbulent flight.P.S. Thank you Doug Liman for your satchel charge effort to blow the doors off this scandal. Iran Contra still screams out for an in-depth and tell-all docudrama production that lets the political fall-out descend as it may and truly takes no prisoners. I am currently working on that project.', 'I was lucky to get an advanced screening. First off, at least it kept my attention the whole way through. I had previously seen Cruise in the ""Mummy"" movie recently released and was not impressed with his acting there.In this movie he returned to form and therefore the story-line was far more plausible. I say story-line, but in reality it is one of those docu-drama\'s, being based on fact. I wonder how much was dramatization as there were some parts where you would ask ""did this sh*t really happen?!""Would I be inclined to add it to my DVD collection, no. It was good as a one time showing. I suspect the length of it worked somewhat against it. A long movie needs to build up to a crescendo, and whilst this had lots of action it never seemed to hit that top note.', 'At first i thought this movie will be boring as hell because of biography and crime genre, many movie with similar genre failed to bring the movie to success. I think it will be hard to make this kind of movie but Doug Liman as the director and Tom Cruise as the main character (Barry Seal) make this movie to the top of their best !The story telling is good and makes the audience can follow it easily. Its not too complex, but not plain too. Many humour inside it and Tom Cruise acting really makes it real ! And because this movie based on true story, and has reveal one of many dark secret on USA government, it makes this movie more interesting ! I cant believe this movie can be one of my favourite and be the one of top on my list. So recommended for the audience who love crime story with comedy, just try it !', 'Bored TWA pilot Barry Seal is prevailed upon by shadowy CIA operative ""Shafer"" to fly spy photography missions for them and, subsequently, to courier materials to and from Noriega in Panama. This turns quickly and easily into smuggling cocaine for the Medellin cartel. Much money results and, before he knows it, Seal is in the middle of a very big, lucrative and dangerous business.Barry Seal was a real person, and the events shown in this film largely took place. I\'m not sure if they would have taken place in quite the way they are shown here, though. Tom Cruise plays Seal as a likeable chap, an almost-loser who is a mix between savvy and naive, and blessed with an ability to regard morally reprehensible activity as somehow justifiable.The film is played almost as a comedy and is quite amusing throughout, despite the questionable and occasionally violent activity which takes place.I enjoyed it, but I found myself wondering about both the morality of portraying Seal as a likeable schmuck whose only crime was finding himself out of his depth, and also the presentation of what happened as a comedy. These were not merry japes.', ""What a turgid bore fest.Don't get me wrong I like Tom Cruise but we have all seen these stories before and made much better - Lord Of War with Nick Cage was ten times better film than this.Was not exciting in the least - there seemed to be a missing tension in the story; whether this was because of Tom Cruise' blasÃ© performance and seeming safe atmosphere it just didn't convey any danger, suspense or even anything new to add to the genre.Seen it all before drug cartel movies are ten a penny and this was not even worth a penny! Cannot believe the high 7.1 mark for this, just shows the level of expectation of our reality TV generation - how sad!"", ""After seeing the trailer of American Made, I was looking forward to this film. The trailer is misleading to say the least. I expected a combo of Blow and The Wolf Of Wallstreet. However, this film does not contain anything we haven't seen before. There are many movies with similar stories to this one, but none of them are this boring. There is no suspense in this movie. The story is not cohesive and predictable. It is not to blame on the acting of the cast. It's just a badly written story and the movie is to long."", ""Tom Cruise is back with a vengeance and after the train wreck that was The Mummy i can safely say that this movie proved that Cruise can act and Liman can direct.While the narrative structure isn't always the best flowing the movie delivers great performances, an atmosphere that sucks you into the time period, and well made shots.A highly underrated movie that i would personally recommend and a definite 8/10."", ""This is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Cruise acted downright silly and the whole thing came off as a joke. I couldn't tell what the genre was suppose to be. A drama, a comedy, adventure ??? It reminded me of a little boy who loves airplanes so he made a movie just so he could fly one or pretend to.In all seriousness, I thought it was insulting."", ""A great story perfectly representing those years and with a stunning performance by Tom Cruise. I would say one of the best movie ever, in this genre, which is midway between a CIA based film and a biopic one. Barry's narration, delivered direct to camera, takes the form of a series of clips from a fuzzy home video supposedly shot in the mid-1980s, laying out the historical background in a dense fashion (he pretends at one point to confuse two countries) which seems most directly indebted to Adam McKay's The Big Short. The biggest coup is the casting of Cruise, who functions as a pure icon, recycling all his usual mannerisms â the grin, the hand gestures â and even revisiting his past as a pilot in Top Gun. The catch is that his depthless showboating for once seems intended as anything but likable."", 'Tom Cruise was once one of Amercas biggest stars but lately outside of the Mission Impossible franchise his star has been in decline with one bomb after another.In 2017 alone Cruise starred in the awful Mummy reboot and now the equally awful American Made.Someone needs to find Cruise a new agent because this film was AWFUL so bad me and my wife asked for a refund.By the way a scene with future president Bill Clinton in a stript club was deleted. It should have stayed in because he worked with Barry Seals as governor of Arkansas where Seals lived. Clinton did after all get Seals out of jail several times in the film.']",/posters/xAmerican.jpg

My Score: 8/10', '""Den of Thieves"" is an entertaining crime film with the showdown of Los Angeles County Sheriff ""Big Nick"" O\'Brien and his team, and the criminal Ray Merrimen and his skilled gang of bank robbers. The plot is full of action and twists and the identity of the mastermind is a great surprise. The pace is perfect and the viewer does not feel the 140 minutes running time. The shootout recalls ""Heat"" and O\'BrienÂ´s personal drama with his wife is pointless and only a filler in the story. ""Den of Thieves"" is not a film for intellectuals and the target audiences will be very satisfied. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Covil de LadrÃµes"" (""Den of Thieves"")', ""Heist movie are either supposed to be very funny which do not care about realities of life and every flaw is supposed to be a joke or they are supposed to have a mind boggling ending. So either the funny type or the serious type. This movie was neither. Story had a lot of loopholes and just didn't seem plausible even by liberal interpretations. Problem is it was intended to be the second type of movie i.e. the serious type. Gerard Butler portrayed Big Nick whose personal life story had no relation whatsoever to the main story, and thus, story was all over the place. Aside from that, if we don't analyze the story; action scenes, acting and cinematography was not bad. So, if you are just looking for a mildly intriguing movie after a tiring day after work, I suppose this movie might work for you."", ""I love a good heist movie. There've been some classics in the genre. THE ITALIAN JOB and OCEAN'S ELEVEN stand out in my memory. So when I heard a new heist film was out called DEN OF THIEVES starring Gerard Butler I was in. Sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations though.The movie opens with an armored car robbery that goes awry. A guard is shot and killed, not something Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) the master planner had in mind. A shootout follows but the team escapes and he later reprimands the weak member of his team for not following orders.The next day Det. Nick O'Brien (Butler) arrives to investigate the case. He and his team of elite no-nonsense officers have been tracking Merrimen for a while now. Through various leads and questionable methods of interrogation they begin to think they may have an idea of what the big heist is going to be. They just need to fill in the details.As all of this is going along we also get a glimpse of O'Brien's home life. Like most police in movies like this his marriage is a shambles. He's also finding it difficult to spend quality time with his child. The end result is his wife leaving and moving in with her sister while filing for divorce.The day of the heist arrives and O'Brien and his team have staked out the bank they know Merrimen is going to hit. Hit it he does taking those inside the bank hostage and threatening to kill them if he doesn't get money and a helicopter out of the bank. Stalling for time O'Brien and his team placate Merrimen. Until they realize something just isn't right. SPOILER ALERT: This is when the movie gets good. We discover that the bank job was cover for a much larger plan, stealing used bills intended for destruction at the nearby Federal Reserve. As the job is going down O'Brien and his team realize what's happening and race to the scene to take down Merrimen and his team. The film ends with a major chase and shootout taking up most of the last hour of the film. It's a tense struggle and not everyone will come out alive. But the movie doesn't end there. And that is the best part about the movie, the end. So if you decide to watch it keep in mind it's not over until the credits roll.So what's good about the movie? It has an involved plot that needs paid attention to to be followed. The story here of the elite commando type team of criminals facing off against the best of the best of the police works well. And to make things a bit different the criminals are more inclined appear the more elite team than the police. The police are the gruff looking tough talking types some movies have gone towards. This takes us to the bad. The language used by Butler here actually becomes distracting after a while rather than help form his character. He's not a character we care much about. There isn't a sympathetic character to associate yourself with. The criminals are willing to kill anyone who gets in their way. The police squad comes off as unruly, undisciplined in certain circumstances and just plain mean. Who do you root for?Then there's the length of the film. There's no reason for this film to last nearly two and a half hours. It's not that epic of a story. Plenty of scenes could have been trimmed to bring the movie down to even two hours. If film directors in the 30s and 40s could make a decent film and tell an entire story in under 80 minutes why do today's directors feel the need to expand the length of a film for no reason?While watching this film I kept thinking back to the movie HEAT from 1995 starring Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. That movie lasted nearly three hours and didn't feel near as long as this one did. I was thinking that the director here felt he was making a monumental epic in the tradition of that film. If that was the case he failed miserably. The movie is entertaining enough for a single viewing but nothing that I would make myself sit through again or add to my collection. It's simply there."", ""This film was a good romp and a solid 7 in my opinion. It crtainly doesn't deserve some of the ludicrous scores some people have rated it on here! Well acted and plenty of action. Then again I always thought Heat was overrated (probably would give that a 7 as well). I didn't feel it was overlong and din't get bored once. Yes, there were a few plot holes, but overrall this was good entertainment and so much better than much of the absolute dross that's doing the rounds at present. Don't listen to the naysayers on here, this one is well worth your time.""]",/posters/xDen.jpg

Miller']","['Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had ""Foul Language"" and ""Sex Scenes"" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.', 'Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade\'s disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named ""Deadpool"", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade\'s disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.', ""I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too, and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool? Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago. Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it. Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for that alone."", 'One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn\'t even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn\'t add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn\'t feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. ""superheroes"", ""superslaves"" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of ""F"" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters are terrible.', 'If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.The story is about as hollow as the humor. It\'s a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of ""love"" that is as misguided as the character\'s personality.The movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny. This is the most overrated movie I\'ve seen. Most of these reviews on IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow film like no other.Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.', ""Out of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The jokes were not funny. The scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well done.They tried to put in 2 X-Men character in the worst possible way. It really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters, but instead they invested a lot in the slow-motion special effect, which was cool.In terms of story-line, there's no story. There's no character building as well. For about 2 hours, all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character. Not funny and irritate the ear.I wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this website...Worst Marvel Movie Ever."", ""Ryan Reynolds is the embodiment of the Deadpool character. He did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is. In my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character. Before watching the movie, I was a bit afraid the story of Wade would slowdown the roller-coaster ride, bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie. Not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the Marvel universe was pulled into the story, but I'm not completely sure of it :). The fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very Deadpool."", ""Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie. yeah sure, when he cracks one or two jokes, its funny, but my gosh he would go on and on ! Regarding the sexual scenes of the movie, if one wants to watch porn, they'd watch porn. I don't know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end ? Even during sex he is cracking lame jokes. Cant get any more ridiculous than that ! As for the storyline , couldn't they add a little more detail. Its like they thought making him blabber throughout the movie will allow them to cut some finer details out. One of the worst movies ever made in the last century !"", ""If I've to keep it short - the movie is really, really bad.There are plenty of jokes, plenty, even when yo don't want one. These jokes are true to Deadpool, but that's it. They are the jokes Deadpool would crack, but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funny.There's absolutely no story in the movie, none at all. On top of that if you've watched all the trailers, watching movie is worthless. The entire story is - Ajax converted Wade into Deadpool, Deadpool searched him to fix his face and once it's cleared that Ajax is not going to do that, Deadpool killed him. Yeah, entire 10 minutes stretched into a almost 2 hour movie. On top of that, for some reason Ajax kidnaps Pool's girlfriend and sets target on his back. It makes no sense.Apart from jokes, Deadpool also has inner voice, but not in this movie. He's most of the time blabbering to himself because of that, making it much more unfunny.There cannot be much said about the movie as it's just extended trailer done badly."", 'This movie is a huge disappointment, and a waste of money and time. The jokes are stupid and I realize that Deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be. Too bad as I usually love the Marvel movies. It seems forced, and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level, more adolescent bathroom style humor. The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes. At times I thought to walk out, but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive, I kept hoping. This movie is more about money-making hype, with its non existent story/plot and childish humor with no depth. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.', ""I enjoyed every minute in this movie. This will become an instant classic and one of the best movies Marvel has made. From the first scene i was blown away. If you are 12 or older i highly recommend you watch this movie. I can't say more without spoiling the movie so go see it. I was at the cinema with my girlfriend and she is not a Deadpool fan, but after she saw the movie she wanted to buy the Deadpool comics to learn more about him. This is how good the movie was. The first 15- 20 minutes of the movie are probably the best intro to a movie i have ever seen. And here is a tip. Stay after the ending credits. You will not regret it."", ""The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas. The story is simple and silly and boring. Man sleeps with woman long in different scenes (Teens hello! Better watch porn, there are more details!) Man go's to basement to become special. (Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE ENDThe jokes are not only lame, they are old. For example the joke with the red shirt and brown trousers I heard from my grandpa.Don't waste your time with this film. Marvell tries to squeeze out last cents out of the theme. Bad films will follow."", ""With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole."", ""slow mo action explosion romance explosion again x men more explosions a deep and intense story followed by more explosions so funny go watch it you won't regret the dirty jokes and explosions will keep you entertained until the end of the 2-hour movie I'd never really paid much attention to Deadpool until now 10 out of 10""]",/posters/xDeadpoolÂ (2016).jpg
Sherlock GnomesÂ (2018) ,(2018),4.9,1h 26min,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']",PG,"Garden gnomes, Gnomeo & Juliet, recruit renowned detective Sherlock Gnomes to investigate the mysterious disappearance of other garden ornaments.",John Stevenson,Ben Zazove,"['Kelly Asbury,', 'Mary J. Blige,', 'Emily Blunt']","[""Garden gnomes, Gnomeo & Juliet, recruit renowned detective Sherlock Gnomes to investigate the mysterious disappearance of other garden ornaments. Sherlock Gnomes has an impressive cast of names like Johnny Depp, Emily Blunt, Michael Caine and more and the animation is quite well but the film's marketing was terrible on point where it became more of an adult film rather than a child's one with twerking and a Gnomes that is half naked that gave me nightmares and unfortunately the film itself isn't any better. The jokes fall flat, the story is predictable and the overall film as a whole is bland and with no soul. Sherlock Gnomes could have been a great movie but it ends being a waste of time and talent. (2/10)"", 'The trailer should have been a dead giveaway that this would be a horrible movie. This movie made me sick with the sense of potty humor in this. A little is okay for the kids, but this was ridiculous. And it did make me uncomfortable. It was also just a bad story.However, I have to give credit to the writers for throwing in those adult jokes that definitely gave parents and older kids a chuckle.But still. Save your money.', 'I was hesitant about seeing ""Sherlock Gnomes"", as its simple wordplay title makes it easy to dismiss. I tell you honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and frankly at the end I was surprised by how much I had enjoyed it. It is far funnier, and far more creative, than its throw-away pun of a title would suggest.True, the story, which takes often broad comedic swipes at a well-established literary franchise, dares to ask its audience to accept the dual conceits that not only do we humans share our world with clay/ceramic garden gnomes which are actually living sentient creatures, but also that one of them is a hyper-intelligent investigator with a strong sense of duty. But once the story gets going (lead into by a Looney Tunes-esque news report), it does prove to have a surprisingly complex plot, in which there is in fact is a mystery in need of solving.Performances of minor and supporting characters range from acceptable to very good. The leads are very well done. Depp\'s Sherlock is arrogant and socially awkward yet comically unaware of this; he\'s also dry almost to the point of being the ""straight man"". Ejiofor readily elicits sympathy for his exasperated and put-upon Watson. McAvoy\'s Gnomeo and Blunt\'s Juliet are played with a good range of emotions, although in my opinion McAvoy goes further, for comedy/action effect.With so many full-CGI movies today, especially those ostensibly meant for children, it\'s easy for the viewer to get jaded and miss the details. This is unfortunate, because often the filmmakers put great detail into their films which enrich the viewing, even if those details are only seen subconsciously. ""Sherlock Gnomes"" is just such a movie, with often stunningly-rendered CGI. In an ""over the shoulder"" shot of Sherlock talking with Juliet, the side of his pointy, aquiline nose can be seen; it shows flecks and minor chips like an actual ceramic figure would have. This gives more visual weight to the scene than it would\'ve had if that surface were rendered simply as a smooth plane. In another scene, we see that the apron strings tied around Juliet\'s back are not three-dimensional moving objects; they are in fact rendered to look hand-painted on, as they would be on an actual garden figure. A city scene of people walking past shops is so well-rendered, for a moment I actually thought I was seeing footage rather than animation. Along with the quality of the CGI, this film also has highly creative visuals. Sherlock\'s ""mind palace"" sequences are beautifully rendered as line-art animations.It is this rich detail which makes the film\'s one down point stand out so poorly. While the movie\'s soundtrack features much music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this is not a musical. For me, the inclusion of what was in essence a music video in the middle of the story was very jarring. The song is performed by a doll voiced by Mary J. Blige. Her character is well-rendered, and her dialogue is nicely delivered; however her singing style combined with the over-produced music made the lyrics almost entirely unintelligible. I found myself wandering off, which was regrettable because I realized I had been missing more great visuals. In the background are very impressive ""dance troupe"" animations which clearly have Ziegfeld/Berkeley/Esther Williams-esque choreography. These are easy to miss but definitely deserve to be noticed.Some weak gags in the trailer are not used in the film, to the film\'s improvement; one that does remain leads to a ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" reference which works well.Finally, the film\'s well-placed tribute to Ray Harryhausen is to be greatly appreciated.Overall, ""Sherlock Gnomes"" is a surprisingly well-executed and enjoyable comedy. Only that misplaced song keeps me from scoring it higher. This is a great movie for kids, and a creative treat for adults, especially parents. 9 out of 10.', '5 minutes into the movie, you could hear children asking their parents about what was happening??\nWho & What is Sherlock? 10 minutes into movie, kids wanting to go get candy or a drink or needing to go to the restroom. Upon their return, it was a buzz of chaos from the kids, again! 1/2 way through the movie, you could tell this movie was a flop to the kids. I tried to fill my G-daughter in on who Sherlock Holmes was......and to lay the plot up to her so she could catch up from her own Popcorn break.... but, she had already lost interest and was looking around at the other kids in the theater and asking how much longer was left of the movie, so we could go bowling. Not an attention getter for kids.', ""You know, call me crazy, but I didn't think this film was half bad.Of course it's predictable. Of course it's cheesy, But underneath that all is a great story, great characters to latch onto, and some surprisingly funny. Luckily Mankene wasn't in the movie too much.I'm gonna have to give it a B or on an Imdb scale, a 7/10. Fun family entertainment."", '. . . legitimize the Gnoming of Sherlock? the Holmsian Legion currently debates. With Chi essaying ""Dr. Watson"" as his springboard to ""James Bond,"" Captain Sparrow seems happy to walk the plank for Better Holmes and Garden Gnomes. Though ""Mary J."" appears less of a MUDBOUND gnome and more like the odd woman out here, DR. WHO\'s now a Lady, so anything goes in London. ""Professor Moriarty"" is branching out into pies, but there\'s a one in 3.1416 chance that ""Jack Horner"" won\'t find six and twenty blackbirds in his Christmas Pudding. ""MARY POPPINS"" may have lost her pipes well before her tuneless remake; however, Lord John makes up for that by breaking wind beneath the wings of SHERLOCK GNOMES. Queen Kate of THE LION IN WINTER might not have survived long enough to reprise her 52-pick-up trick from BRINGING UP BABY--yet SHERLOCK GNOMES packs enough rats that no one will miss the cheetahs when Dino\'s dad collapses.', 'Sherlock Gnomes is a fun enough adventure for kids under the age of 6, but for older audiences it offers nothing interesting enough to keep you entertained. The music from Elton John is upbeat enough to lighten the mood from the boring story. The animation is decent and the humour is tolerable but is mostly gnome puns.', ""Gnomeo and Juliet and the other gnomes we met in the first film move (or, more correctly, are moved) to London, where they find themselves in the middle of a spree of gnome thefts. The enlist the help of celebrated detective Sherlock Gnomes to track down their missing friends.\n \nThe original movie had a kind of odd, wholly British charm, and this sequel captures part of that. A great voice cast indulges in a vast number of silly jokes, many of them gnome-based, many of them mildly rude, in a plot which is a detective story mystery with a little bit of character stuff added in.I've got to say that, notwithstanding the star-studded voice work and my affection for animation, this film pleased me more in the little touches (the pottery clinking sounds accompanying the gnomes moving) than in the whole. It's undemanding, but with little charm.It didn't really grab me."", 'Utter pants film whose best bit was the voice from Ozzy.

It has action, comedy, good music, and uplifting themes, making it an entertaining movie for kids and watchable enough for parents.\nTips for parents: Profanity like ""Cheese & Crackers!"" and ""Fertilizer!""\nYou see quite a bit of a dancing gnome in a thong. If you saw the first Gnomeo & Juliet, you\'ve already been introduced to Mankini, a character kids will laugh at, yet one who is pretty inappropriate for young children, in my opinion. The first Gnomeo & Juliet was rated G, but this one is PG for using some rude and suggestive humor. Mankini\'s appearances definitely bumped up the rating. \nThere is some potty humor that will make most parents squirm.\nSome subtitles\nAll British accents and landmarks in London.\nUplifting theme: ""We all have our good and bad sides."" - Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor)\n""A man doesn\'t make you strong, but the right partner can make you stronger."" - Juliet (Emily Blunt)\n""We took our best friends for granted.

If only they had gotten Benedict Cumberbatch to play the voice! He does a fantastic job in the TV adaptation. That would have been awesome and hilarious. Don\'t get me wrong, because Johnny Depp was fine, but Cumberbatch as Sherlock...come on!\nThere are a lot of jokes that kids simply won\'t get because they\'re references to older generations, like the River Dance gag.\nI started to get bored.

The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it.', ""Fun movie for family. Silly at times with decent action and interesting people.

I recommend!"", 'Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!Starting at 1996, a young man finds a ""board game"" on the beach after hearing the iconic ""jungle drums"" sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand. Like the original, he finds it, takes it home with him, & then finds out it\'s an Nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing, he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game, similar to the original, but as a computer games console, not a board game, interesting take.So fast forward 21 years later, & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school. It\'s then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game. They then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout ""Jumanji!"".The film I thought was pretty good! Of course it wouldn\'t be nearly as good as it\'s counter back in \'95, but it\'s pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is! The story was simple & easy to follow, the characters were great & likable, Karen Gillan was a babe in this film! (sorry had to say it!), but she & the others were great! I also liked the humour in this film too! It was funny & fitted well!I was kind of peeved it wasn\'t set in the real world as appose to a jungle, but I suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way, & it wasn\'t too bad either!Overall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film! 9/10 Go watch it!', ""I actually come to watch this movie with low expectation. I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too."", 'Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it\'s 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It\'s a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it\'s not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I\'ve seen things you\'ve only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany.

UnsaneÂ (2018) ,(2018),6.5,1h 38min,"['Horror', 'Thriller']",R,"A young woman is involuntarily committed to a mental institution, where she is confronted by her greatest fear--but is it real or a product of her delusion?",Steven Soderbergh,Jonathan Bernstein,"['Claire Foy,', 'Joshua Leonard,', 'Jay Pharoah']","['As someone who works in the mental health field, the first act of this movie excited me. The set up seemed to suggest a film that would attempt to capture the experience of a psychotic individual who finds herself involuntarily committed; to convey the confusion and desperation of such an experience for the patient, and perhaps the callousness of the staff who have become so jaded to such a presentation that they fail to meet the emotional needs of that patient. I felt genuinely uncomfortable through the first 20-30 minutes of the film as this scenario was explored, so much so that it forced me to reflect on my own experiences with psychotic patients and how important it is not to lose that level of empathy regardless of how routine the work may become. Furthermore, I was tantalized by the possibilities of the film in blurring the line between delusion and reality, expecting it to keep me questioning what was real and what wasn\'t.And then the film throws all of that into a wood chipper. And burns the wood chips. Unfortunately, from here I\'m really going to have to get into specifics, ie spoilers, so,***SPOILERS***First, I just have to mention the numerous inaccuracies here in the depiction of an inpatient psychiatric ward. The physical setup of the facility is quite odd with its communal bedroom shared by all of the patients which is locked every night without any staff member being physically present inside. Even more unlikely is that during the day the patients are allowed to wander around the rest of the facility without seemingly any security. I\'ll concede that I obviously haven\'t seen every possible inpatient setting design, but this is quite removed from anything I\'m familiar with.More problematic though are the way restraints and seclusions are portrayed in the film. Restraints and forced medication can happen if an agitated patient is unable to be calmed by any other measure and is at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others, but patients are never restrained in a communal room and then left alone for extended periods of time, unmonitored by staff, and no less surrounded by other inpatients who are often psychotic and potentially dangerous. Medication injections are also always given in a muscle rather than in a vein as depicted here, and certainly never in a neck vein. Patients placed in a seclusion room are highly monitored and there are extremely strict regulations on how long a seclusion can last. It can not be used punitively and for indefinite periods of time as portrayed here. Opiate addiction on its own is never an indication for an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and would never be covered by insurance. Staff members would never be able to secretly move patients to remote areas in a facility and hold them hostage there - everything is video monitored and it is standard for every patient to be physically checked on by nursing staff every 15 minutes.I could keep going, but I won\'t. Afterall, this is a movie. Films often can take liberties with reality, though for a film like this that is examining the mental health system and offering commentary on it, the gross inaccuracies are more problematic. Still, I did my best to see these as artistic liberties taken in the service of telling a story, entertaining an audience, and conveying a message. The problem is that the film fails on all of these levels as well.I mentioned earlier that I was tantalized at the possibilities that the film set up in blurring the line between delusion and reality, and I was completely let down. There is absolutely no ambiguity here, no intrigue, no possible interpretation where the stalker isn\'t real. And while that\'s far less interesting to me, it at least could\'ve worked as an entertaining B-movie. But the plot is so offensively absurd that it crumbles even with the most cursory critical analysis. How did this stalker manage to get a job as a nurse at this facility within 24 hours of our protagonist showing up there? Did he kill the real nurse and pose as him? No - because then the nursing staff obviously would recognize him as an imposter in that case. Furthermore, a co-worker specifically comments that he is one of the most dependable nurses they have which obviously indicates he has some history at the job. So then is it a coincidence that our protagonist chose this facility from her random google search and her stalker just happened to have taken a job there prior? Did I miss some explanation for this? Even if I did, it\'s just incredibly improbable to the point of pure contrivance.And then our stalker is able to kidnap patients, hold them hostage, torture and kill them, all within a secured and staffed facility where patients would be monitored continuously as I previously mentioned. I had to stifle laughter when he explains to the protagonist, whom he is now indefinitely holding hostage in a seclusion room on a seemingly deserted, unstaffed floor of the hospital (which in itself is ludicrous), that the other staff members just ""assumed"" that she had been discharged and her insurance coverage had expired. A patient cannot be discharged from a hospital like this without clearance and direct orders from a psychiatrist, who then prepares all of the necessary paperwork, prescriptions, referrals to outpatient providers etc. It is a multidisciplinary process that involves the psychiatrist, nurses, and social workers. It\'s utterly laughable that the film asks you to believe that a patient would just be ""assumed"" discharged from a facility like these when none of this process had taken place.***END OF SPOILERS***Again, I could keep going but I\'d be beating a dead horse. Highly disappointed with this film, and sadly it will likely perpetuate so many of the negative stigmas surrounding psychiatric hospitals. It does have some striking visuals here and there, the lead performance is quite good, and I did enjoy the raw quality of the filmmaking, but this is nowhere near enough to make up for its issues. I couldn\'t even recommend it to someone who has no knowledge of the mental health world as it totally fails as campy B horror/thriller too with its absurd plot and utter failure to capitalize on the potential for intrigue/ambiguity in the setup. Skip it.1.5/5', 'Just returned from watching this.\nFound it totally absorbing. I found the format drew me in, making the viewing very claustrophobic.\nSome viewers have complained of a lack of realism, both in the premise of the film and the use of an iPhone, but its escapism people. \nSwitch off your inner critic and enjoy the ride.', ""This review won't state anything someone else hasn't said more eloquently, but by god I have to add my own to the reviews because of my disgust with the decently high rating despite an awful , incomprehensible, and unbelievable plot. The movie starts out well with the viewer uncertain about what is real and what may be a delusion we are seeing from the protagonist's point of view. Then after a very drawn out and tedious key scene, it falls apart, combusts, and you are left with the ashes flying into your face wondering how anyone did or said any of the things they did."", ""As a slightly jaded horror movie buff, I only watched this because of the Steven Soderbergh tag, hoping for something new and different from a high profile director. Safe to say, will never watch a movie again just for the Steven Soderberg tag. It tries too hard and frankly gets nowhere. Basically someone who looks like the chick from Twilight is being stalked by a skinny version of John Goodman and for the whole movie we are made to cringe at how dumb they made all the other characters in order for the plot to proceed. One of those movies where everyone has single digit IQs so the killer can conveniently do his thing, no matter how unlikely it would be in the real world. No big surprises, scares, twists, intrigue etc...just a paint by numbers affair where we're supposed to marvel at the iPhone camera gimmickry."", 'Just an awful, boring, lame movie. Bad acting mixed with a boring yet confusing plot. The director used a camera phone to film. You should use a blindfold to watch.', ""Here's a movie that has an interesting plot and raises a few good questions but that's the extent of it. It falls flat in EVERY aspect remaining. There's no twist. Hardly a mediocre reveal for one character. Just boring."", ""Unsane came out on Friday to some mixed reviews from critics and audiences all over the world and finally after lots of digging for cash, I finally got to see this anticapated film! The film follows a young woman, played by Claire Foy who is institutionalized into a sanatariom after she fills out a few therapy papers and soon enough she then finds out to make it worse that her mad stalker is now a member of staff and out to take her away so she can become his own. I was so excited to see Unsane because I loved the idea and it's awesome trailer and what did I think; weeeeell, apart from a few small differences then to what I expected, it was a awesome horror film. The acting was superb and it was very clever and very intense. Clare Foy was amazing as Valentino and so was Joshua (i forget his second name, but he played the stalker) and so was Juno Temple and of course! Amy Irving?! I mean what the hell, Amy Irving, I thought she retired like years ago so it was fun to see her again cause I never knew she was going to be in it and she was also great. Unsane is a clever, intense and very atmospheric movie with great acting that keeps it fresh!"", ""I was probably instantly attracted to seeing this film from the unusual but clever title, I read more about it as it got closer to its release date, and then there were positive comments from critics, so hoped for something good, Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Traffic, Ocean's Eleven, Side Effects). Basically Sawyer Valentini (The Crown's Claire Foy) is a bright but troubled businesswoman, she has become successful in her new position and maintains healthy relationships with her co-workers. But she has become distant from her mother Angela (Amy Irving) since moving away, it is revealed that she actually moved to escape a stalker who had been terrorising her for two years. Sawyer seeks a support group for victims of harassment, she has an initial consultation at the local hospital, during which she confesses that she has contemplated suicide in the past. Sawyer is given documents to sign, she is confused when she is asked to hand over her belongings and change into a hospital gown, Nurse Boles (Polly McKie) tells her that she has signed a consent form, committing her to spend 24 hours in the hospital's psychiatric ward. Sawyer calls the police, but they are unwilling to intervene, as they get calls like hers all the time, her situation is worsened when she has an aggressive argument with fellow patient Violet (Juno Temple), and she attacks an orderly, mistaking them for her stalker, her stay is upgraded to a week. Sawyer is horrified to discover that one of the orderlies is her stalker, David Strine (Joshua Leonard), he has obtained a job at the asylum to get close to her, her outbursts and protesting cause her to be considered mentally unstable, so she is repeatedly sedated and given drugs. At one point, David intentionally gives her an overdose of pills, causing her to become disorientated and violent, the nurse notices to error, but does not recognise that it was deliberate. Sawyer is cold towards the orderlies and other patients, but she warms to recovering opiate addict Nate Hoffman (Jay Pharaoh), he knows that the hospital and its parent company are committing clinically sane people to extort money from insurance companies. Sawyer tells how she met David, it was whilst working with an Alzheimer's patient when she volunteered at a hospice facility, David was his son, when David's father died, he became obsessed with Sawyer, fanatically texting her and even breaking into her house. Nate has a smuggled cell phone that Sawyer notices him using, he allows her to use it to call her mother, Angela is determined to help her daughter get out. But the police, and her lawyer, are unwilling to help, due to the consent form, it is suggested they wait for the week to end, after which the hospital are legally obliged to release her. David notices Nate and Sawyer spending time together, during the night David knocks Nate unconscious and tortures him in the basement, before injecting and killing him with an overdose of fentanyl. The orderlies believe Nate's death was caused by his drug addiction, David taunts Sawyer, sending her images of the bloodied Nate, in another act of aggression she scolds Violet with hot coffee, she is placed in solitary confinement. While in solitary, Sawyer is repeatedly visited by David, she is initially aggressive towards him, berating and mocking him for his lack of sexual experience and unrealistic fantasies about them being together, this causes him to break down in tears, and he attempts to strangle her. On his next visit, David tells Sawyer that he hacked into the hospital's computer system with false information, they believe that she has been released, he suggests that they should run away together to a log cabin he has renovated. Seeing an opportunity to escape, Sawyer convinces David to have sex with Violet in front of her to prove himself, he drugs Violet and brings her to solitary, Sawyer grabs Violet's contraband weapon and stabs David, she flees, while David in rage breaks Violet's neck. Sawyer escapes the hospital, but David catches up, knocks her out and puts her in the car trunk, along with the corpse of Angela, who he killed earlier. Sawyer manages to break out and escape, David catches up again and breaks her ankle with a hammer, but Sawyer managed to grab her mother's crucifix, she stabs David in the eye with it, and finally cuts his throat. The police eventually show up, they realise that David had been using a stolen identity after finding the corpse of the man he killed to gain access to the hospital, and it is revealed that Nate was an undercover investigative journalist, his notebook detailing criminal activities lead to the arrests of the staff. Six months later, Sawyer has recovered and is having lunch with a colleague, but then she sees a man she thinks is David sitting at another table in the restaurant, she grabs a knife and approaches, but realises she is delusional, she runs out, she glances behind and it ends on a freeze frame, clearly her nightmares will continue. Also starring Aimee Mullins as Ashley Brighterhouse, Sarah Stiles as Jill and Matt Damon as Detective Ferguson. Foy does give a great performance and is the best thing about the film, being sarcastic and occasionally nasty, in a good way, special mention should go to the terrific support of Temple as a wild-child patient, and the cameo from Damon is a bit daft and badly timed. Mark Kermode made comparisons to the Samuel Fuller classic Shock Corridor, I can see why, being set in a mental institution, it starts out as fairly plausible and intriguing, you do feel sympathy for the leading character, then it just goes far-fetched and over the top, I wanted to like it a bit more, overall it is a very average psychological horror thriller. Okay!"", 'I expected this movie to be edgy and interesting; it was neither. The acting was amateurish and the plot was heavy-handed. It was supposed to be psychological thriller in which we are to figure out whether or not the protagonist is insane, but instead we are driven crazy by randomness of the plot. Too many characters are introduced that muddle the focus of the film, and zero get any sort of character development. Not even the main character shows any sort of arc or growth. Was expecting a Shelter Island-esque film--instead I got a movie filmed on an iPhone that seems to have been written by my fourteen year old son.', ""This movie's plot could've had some serious potential, but somehow the writers went the worst possible direction with it. It goes from strong psychotic doubt(which is a very interesting) for about 5 minutes, then quickly deteriorated to a cringey, predictable, slow-paced sh*tshow."", ""This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever sat through. The whole audience was cringing at how bizarre the movie was and how many plot holes were throughout the entirety. At the conclusion, comments were made by the entire audience wanting their time and money back. Everyone was laughing and could not believe how awful this was. I have never written a review before but wanted to for this because I don't want someone to waste their time. I'm still shaking my head at how bad the movie was."", 'First I\'m a fan of director Soderberg. I\'m a huge fan of Claire Foy (The Crown) but this movie is infantile in the worst way and every way. It\'s like one of these ""I wrote this in high school and have been trying to make it a film ever since."" Listed as a Thriller, Horror film this is a hint that it is one some of the time and the other at other times separated by childress views of the world. Maybe his arm was tired from holding the iPhone so he left pieces out. Too many plot holes to list. This movie is as close to completely unwatchable as possible. One star for attempting something different. Now back to the drawing board.', 'What a waste of time and money!! So many unrealistic story lines, not scary at all, and the ending is by far one of the worse I\'ve seen! I\'d compare this movie to a bad LMN movie! Don\'t believe...go ahead and waste your time! Oh and Matt Damon has a 5 minute ""Flashback"" cameo which absolutely makes no sense with the plot.', ""After reading the premise of the film and watching first 30mins of the film I expected that we will see an authentic point of view of someone who has mental illness and how irrational such patient's thoughts and behaviour could be. Exploring such topic would have made this more reasonable of a movie, but unfortunately it turns cheap and cheesy grab of shock value with imposible full of holes plot. Why do films of such topic need to go in direction of protagonist being captivated against their will in a scary, dangerous mental institution for only purpose - to harm them, not to help them, also we learn that you can not trust your psychiatrist. This movie had opportunity to be something serious, reasonable, relevant, but instead it became a joke."", ""A young woman is involuntarily committed to a mental institution, where she is confronted by her greatest fear--but is it real or a product of her delusion? Unsane is weird, bizzare, boring and above all has a weird way that it was filmed and it's not good. The acting was horrible, the characters terrible and the story slow as hell, this movie tried to be the next '12 Monkeys' or something along those lines and in my opinion? It failed terribly. Some viewers might enjoy it's bizarre and weird way that it was filmed but casual viewers who might expect something more? Should skip it and see something else that makes sense and isn't boring and a waste of their time and money. (0/10)"", 'Watched this purely because of the novelty of it being filmed on an I-Phone. The fact it was filmed on an I-Phone gives it a very amatuer, college project look. Claire Foy plays a woman who doesn\'t read what she is signing and ends up being committed to a mental institution for 24hours. Her anger at being committed agaisnt her will and her belief that one of the nurses is a guy who forced her to move due to due to his stalking, leads to her being there for longer. \nI found Claire Foy acting to be awful. Especially when she was angry but trying to act ""sane"" to get out of the facility. \nThe film was confusing and not enjoyable to watch at all. Even suspending belief that they would not mix patients of different genders and other things that make no sense, this is still not an enjoyable movie to watch. The writing and acting and obvious errors, along with the whole Iphone thing, just made it feel like a school project of someone with a rich father to fund it. \nI just was left with the feeling of what was the point?

This movie and BVS are the product of a studio with no patience. SPOILERS! 1) Terrible Character Development: This studio gave us no backstory to Wonder Woman and Batman when BvS arrived in theaters, so it flopped. Once again we get no backstory to Aquaman, Cyborg, or Flash. Even Batman hasn't had a solo movie in this DC universe. How do you decide to reboot Batman and you don't even have a solo movie for its central character?! We see this same problem with Suicide Squad. Rushed ensembles with no true backstories and character development. 2) Flashbacks to Mortal Kombat Annihilation:The scene in Atlantis with Aquaman and Mera was cringe x10. The CGI was abysmal and the dialogue exchange between them was even worse. Luckily, James Wan is directing the solo movie (a good director), so there is still hope. I get the feeling that any solo movie will be great, just as long as Zack Snyder has nothing to do with it. Wonder Woman was a great solo movie, then she is thrown into this embarrassment of a movie and her acting becomes flat and unemotional. I blame the director. Ben Affleck just looked so bored throughout the movie. Cyborg's CGI was stuck in the beta phase. It was so bad. Even 1980's Robocop looked better than this. 3) One Mother Box to Rule Them AllThe plot was a literal rip off of Lord of The Rings. One box is given to the Atlantians, another to the Amazons, and the final box is given to man. And man must bury the box at an undisclosed location so that they don't become corrupted. In the movie, modern science has no idea how the box is even supposed to work, so I am not sure how a medieval peasant would figure it out. I'm not even sure in what way they would become corrupted since a single box is completely useless. Steppenwolf looks like Sauron and he must gather the boxes to unlock their power. What an incredibly lazy plot. 4) Your hero is only as great as its villain How do you top fighting a colorless CGI monster with no important backstory or presence in BvS? You get the heroes to fight another colorless CGI monster with no important backstory or presence! There's nothing cerebral or cunning about Steppenwolf. Just a big guy that likes smashing things with a giant hammer. In the comics, he looks human. Why couldn't they at least have a person instead of a CGI monster? I'm just going to watch the solo movies from now on. I feel like Justice League 2 will add on more heroes with zero backstories, to fight another colorless giant CGI monster with zero backstory and simplistic motivations."", ""I grew up watching the Justice League animated series and I enjoyed every DCEU movie so far, so I was really excited to finally see these heroes together for the first time on the big screen. Unfortunately, the movie was a letdown. It's not bad by any means, but it was not as epic as it should have been. Here are my pros and cons:Pros: + The acting is really good + Great chemistry between the League+ Some good action scenes (Amazons vs Steppenwolf is one the best moments of the movie), even though the movie lacks any memorable action like the ones in Man of Steel, BvS or Wonder Woman + Superman is finally done right+ There are some fun scenes+ The Flash is great and you can't ignore Wonder Woman every time she's on screen. Aquaman and Cyborg were fine. Batman was fine as well (Ben Affleck didn't look very interested in this movie as he was in BvS) + The post credit scenes are greatCons: The plot is weak (bad guy wants to destroy the world, just like The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, X-Men: Apocalypse, etc). You can tell how it all ends, everything is very predictable The villain is really awful. I didn't fear him for a second Not a lot of surprises The VFX is a letdown compared to Man of Steel and BvS (Superman's erased mustache is really distracting)Very little character development You can tell basically all the scenes added in reshootsThe jokes didn't work. Most of them are silly, not funny Gal Gadot's acting is not very good in some scenes. It looks like she is as good as her directors. With Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman's director), she was great. Here with Zack Snyder/Joss Whedon, not so much Some of the dialogues are really bad (like the ones with Mera and Aquaman). Half of them are pure exposition The movie lacks stakes or any sense of danger The final battle is really generic The movie is never really exciting. It's almost exciting, but never really really exciting.It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. Unfortunately Justice League is just okay. You won't remember it in a year. I didn't love the movie, but based on the last post credit scene, I'm excited for where this universe can go next."", ""Believe me I wanted to love this movie. I grew up on the Justice League. I love the Justice League. This movie was exactly how I would not do it. Let me begin my review.CGI â I also love CGI. I think we've made some great movie magic with CGI. Here the CGI was so distractingly bad I could not stop wondering how could they do such a bad job with such a huge budget? Let me start with the bad guy â Steppenwolf. The Character looked like it was lifted right out of a video game. He did not look real at all. Honestly this movie looked like they took the Human Actors (plus half and half Superman â I'll get to that) and plopped them right into a video game. It looked like these actors all stood in a sound stage and punch and kicked and jumped. The CGI was so bad the movie lost all sense of realism. It did not help that the directors of this movie has no idea how to put more than 2 characters in a fight scene at any time. Again this took away from the realism also â how do our super heroes fight the alien villains in the middle of a city and not one bystander is in any of the scenes. The world is being destroyed but no one is watching or no one tries running away. Its funny because at one point in the middle of a big fight scene Lois Lane just shows up but no one else including Police or Military does. I sat there in total shock thinking how could some one make such garbage fake scenes. But the most laughable part of the CGI has to do with Superman. I sat there looking at him the whole movie thinking what is wrong with him, he looks off. So afterwards I read that Henry Cavill was filming another movie at the same time as this and in that other movie he was required to have a mustache and beard. So they filmed all his scenes with a beard and CGI'd them out. And it was a terrible job of CGIing the beard out. His face looked off and at points I wondered if it was even Henry playing Superman or a look alike. It was bad and for a movie this BIG it should have been so much better.As for the other Heroes here are my thoughts, but first let me comment on something that bothers a lot of Justice League fans, why did they take all the color and make these movies so dark. This is a big factor on why Marvel makes much better movies than DC. Look at the costume of Batman (all black), Wonder Women/Aquaman/Superman colors dimmed to the point of their outfits are basically black also. Flash looked OK.Batman â Ben Affleck seems to be sleep walking through this movie. He is boring boring boring. Enough said about him.Aquaman â was Aquaman even in this movie? I recall Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and some cyborg guy, but was Aquaman in this movie? Cuz there was some dude that says Bro and Bruh with long hair and a bunch of tattoos. Jason Momoa was not Aquaman. Not only in persona/appearance, but Aquaman did not use his Aqua skills the entire movie. It was like the director has no idea how to pull this off. He was in the water at the beginning a little when he wasn't drinking his big beer and acting all tough like a pirate/surfer at some pub. But not once did Aquaman used his Aqua skills in this movie. In fact, both of the Justice League fight scenes there was no water around. I am not sure what was worse the CGI or Aquaman.Flash â I hear some liked him but I could help wondering was Woody Allen not available at the time of filming? Because the guy who played Flash was trying to be Woody Allen the whole movie. Flash was supposedly the funny one â either him or Aquaman, but neither made me laugh once.Cyborg â Actually Cybrog made me laugh when Steppenwolf pulled off his arms and legs. I laughed out loud at that one. Actually I never knew who cyborg was but from watching this movie he was a fish out of water just like Aquaman. Cyborg apparently deals with Cyber-crimes. Only problem Steppenwolf is from the past and doesn't use computers so Cyborg was useless.Wonder Woman â The best thing about this movie. No complaints here other than her black Wonder Woman outfit.Superman â touched on him earlier. I like Henry Cavill and like his Superman portrayal. He wasn't the best here as he wasn't give much to do. He had a couple heart felt scenes (with Lois and his Mom) and CGI withstanding he looks OK for Superman although he looked small in this one.As for the plot, bad guy from the past wants to destroy the world. Typical but not executed very well.After seeing this movie I could not help but wish they would blow this whole thing up and start over. They hint of the next movie and I just thought â too bad. DC needs to look at what Marvel is doing and copy, please copy. I also saw Thor's movie and that movie was 1000 times better. Take my advice and see Thor instead. A bad movie like this does not deserve to make the kind of movie it is making."", ""I wanted to love this movie, but it suffers from the same mistakes as Batman v. Superman. The plot is jumpy and incoherent, the motivation for the characters are sloppy, and the CGI is lackluster at best. Plus, Henry Cavil's face looked off in this move; you can tell they did a bad job removing his mustache. This movie wasn't all bad though. I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the best thing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terrible script and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring that even Marvel would be jealous. I think Warner Bros. need to make big changes to the DCEU or it's doomed to fail."", ""In short:>Many instances where the CGI and green screens are painfully obvious and stick out like a sore thumb.>The editing is extremely rushed and abrupt in parts, with super important events such as Steppenwolf stealing the 3rd mother box being mentioned in cringey and obvious exposition by wonder woman, before cutting to a random event halfway around the world.>The fight scenes in this film are extraordinarily underwhelming. In almost all the fights, barely any of the characters use their powers, with aqua man simply punching and getting thrown away, wonder woman using her sword instead of her OP abilities shown in her standalone movie, and cyborg literally doing nothing except putting his hands inside a glowing box. The end fight was extremely boring and anticlimactic, with the tension immediately disappearing when superman shows up and completely shuts down steppenwolf.> The villain himself, Steppenwolf, is one of the worst parts of this film. He literally has only one power/ability, which is swinging his pathetic axe around. He is an all CGI uninspired and forgettable villain who isn't menacing in the least. The fight he puts up in the end is disgraceful, with him swinging his axe around a bit then getting completely trashed by superman.Probably in the minority here, but BVS for me was a 7/10, and this is a 5/10."", ""Everyone knows by now that due to unfortunate circumstances, Zack Snyder (Director) and his wife, Deborah Snyder (Producer) had to leave the project for personal reasons, which enticed to the studio (Warner Bros.) to bring in 'Avengers' director Joss Whedon and ''finish'' it. Ultimately, the film seems to have been almost completely re-written and re-shot. I've read a fair amount from people claiming that the film is still around 80% Snyder's vision, I don't think so.The films original composer (Junkie XL) was quickly dispatched and replaced by Danny Elfman (One could argue that a films score makes up 50% of the film, easily).Danny Elfman's score is completely flat and heartless. There isn't a shred of emotion in a single note. It sounds out of place, is consistently uneven and the little homages to past themes seem to be thrown in and are used at completely the wrong times.Almost every scene where Superman appears, he has a ridiculously expensive, computer generated botch job of a mouth to cover up a moustache that Henry Cavill wasn't allowed to shave off for the re- shoots, due to commitments to another film.As I can recall, there was one scene for Superman where he didn't have the CGI mouth.The tone and atmosphere of Snyder's style is almost completely lifted from the film, something I'm sure was tampered with in post- production.It doesn't have any kind of atmosphere at all really, it just feels empty.The actors are all fine and deliver worthy performances for the characters, it's not their fault that the film which is built around them is a complete disaster.It just goes to show that the studio couldn't care in the slightest about delivering a serious and decent production. They had a release date and they forced themselves to stick to it, regardless of the outcome.Most of the film feels completely rushed and cheap, which it shouldn't, given it had a budget of $300 million.It's simply unacceptable for something of this capacity and scale to be the epitome of a mindless product from a bloodsucking and power driven cooperation.Would it have been such a loss to put the project on hold until Zack and Deborah Snyder returned, or delay the film until everything was as good as could possibly be? Apparently yes.There's been absolutely no respect for the source material, the vision of the original director or the target audience from Warner Bros..Zack Snyder's complete version, I'm sure has its faults and flaws, but nothing can compare to this lacklustre effort.This should have been the best superhero film ever made, but has been dropped and fallen straight to the bottom of the barrel.I could go on and on, but I'll stop there."", 'I saw the Film last night and i have not an answer for what they need an budget of 300.000.000 USD. Ugly low-detail locations and semi effects. And this is the end of the world? Roland Emmerich would cry for this crap.the rest of the film is very casual. not the best story so far and the villain is a big joke.', ""Really goes through the motions. An alien lifeform terraforming the planet? Done in Man of Steel and The Avengers. Obligatory superhero smack down? Check. 'Witty' banter? Check. There is literally nothing in Justice League that hasn't been done before, much better too. For a movie that costs so much to make, why does it look so cheap? Plus, The Flash is meant to be comic relief, but is just irritating."", ""The film was okay. Definitely not bad. How I wish Warner Brothers experimented with more standalone films before they finally got to Justice League. As a big DC fan, I was a bit let down. 2hours was definitely not enough to put this film's story across. There were great plot points but everything just seemed to go by too quickly. Henry Cavill's CGI upper lip was very distracting, and his superman- even though I really liked him- but he was just too powerful for Steppenwolf, or maybe Steppenwolf was the one who was too weak for the story they were going for. For someone who wanted to destroy the world, I think he wasn't menacing enough. Ray Fisher was great as Cyborg, I liked Gal Gaddot as Wonder Woman, Mamoa as Aquaman, and even Miller as the flash. But I didn't like how the flash runs in this movie....his legs move in a weird way. Batfleck owned his role obviously. There were great moments in the film, especially when Superman returns and meets the team for the first time. Loved his reunion with Louise and his Mom, and I'm really looking forward to where this universe will go.The first credits scene didn't do anything for me (I thought they'd both run instead of Superman flying).Many scenes in the trailer were not in the movie, and I feel like there was more to this film than what we get to see. The CGI also needed more polishing. It's definitely getting a lot more hate than it deserves. I really feel sorry for Zack Snyder...I know the backlash he gets from people will definitely affect his confidence as a director, especially for DCEU films and his vision of it. I give this movie a 6.5/10. An argument can be made for 7/10. Anyone giving this movie more than a 7/10 is not being completely honest with themselves. I really looked forward to this movie, but the theatrical release hasn't done much for me. Definitely a forgettable movie."", 'As we all know, Zack Snyder (BvS) has a very different vision of superhero movies than Joss Whedon (Avengers). This movie felt like a mish-mash of both incompatible styles. Scenes just happen without any connectivity, the plot is so generic it could have been written by a 5-year old. The attempt by WB Studios to Marvel-ise the movie by bringing in Joss Whedon and shoe-horning in comedy elements is nauseating. Yes, Flash has his comedic moments, but they feel very out of place. Superman\'s jokes are just out of character for what has been established. This should not please BvS and Man of Steel fans, nor should it please Marvel fans who are more into character chops and comedy. What we have is a very unfocused movie with such an uninteresting villain that I felt like they just dragged and dropped him from a Mortal Kombat cutscene. Whatever they were trying to establish with Cyborg\'s struggle as a half-man half-machine falls way flat, so does Wonder Woman\'s attempt at being an anchor for the morality of the team. Batman just mopes around and Flash just goofs around. Jason Momoa was a standout, but that\'s the point - not enough screen time is devoted to any of these characters for us to like them. There are no character arcs. There are certainly some good set pieces in the movie - the Amazon fight was good, so was the final fight scene, although it was very obvious they color-corrected much of it to look at least visible to the naked eye and for that I am thankful to Mr. Whedon. The stand-out scene for me was when Superman wakes up - Superman\'s fight with the team (although contrived in response to the success of Civil War) was interesting and I perked up for a moment, only to be undercut by Steppenwolf going ""YOINK! Stole your BOX"" and Superman returning to Smallville for the highly predictable recuperation scene with a sub-par Lois Lane performance and his mother (MARTHA!). Honestly, they missed a lot of great potential conflict with that subplot. All-in-all, I am surprised by how much everybody seems to be liking movie. I can only attribute that to the die-hard DC fanboyism and the vocal immature majority of the internet. I just want to know what the comic book fans think of this movie. So many great stories involving the Justice League (can someone please show Chris Terrio and his WB overlords the Timmverse JLA series?) This movie falls flat on its face into sub-par cheese cartoonish territory with the rushed team-up plot line and no focus of character chemistry. This is exactly what you would expect from a Zack Snyder helmed WB-DC product which Joss Whedon was hired cleaned up. Kudos to Joss Whedon for adding/modifying scenes that made the movie at least slightly watchable, but I would have loved to have seen a Justice League movie totally helmed by Joss Whedon, or even one which truly represented Zack Snyder\'s vision (however bad it may be). A 50-50 product just made it schlock-central, a betrayal to all involved in the creative process and insulting to the viewers.', 'Zack Snyder\'s ""Justice League"" is nothing more than another poorly made movie in a franchise that\'s practically been dead since its second film. While not as horrible, ""Justice League"" still is not good. The most redeeming factor of the film is some of its characters, but that isn\'t enough to pull this series out of the hole its in. On the plus side, Gal Gadot\'s Wonder Woman still shines, even after her wonderfully made standalone film, and may be the best character in the film. Jason Mamoa\'s Aquaman is a lot of fun, with great humor to go alongside him. Ray Fisher\'s Cyborg is also an interesting and fun character, being equally as good as Momoa, maybe even slightly better. Unfortunately, Ezra Miller\'s Flash does not blend with the darkness of every other character, some saying that is the point, but he is almost too far gone to blend in any way. Then, Affleck\'s Batman is a dry, dull, ill-humored, useless character, and Henry Cavill still broods too much to be fun, and is a somewhat useless addition. The villain of the film is nonthreatening, boring, and plot less, and could be the worst part of the entire film, next to the clichÃ© and boring plot that has been seen in every Avenger\'s movie to this day, and believe me, I hate having to make that comparison. ""Justice League is moderately fun, but still can\'t redeem this helpless series.', 'The long anticipated ""Justice League"" has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion. The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.In a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.The action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I muse d to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot. Affleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.It has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.The biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.In the end ""Justice League"" is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road. As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues. 3 stars out of 5', ""Hey, don't go with high expectations, the movie is far away from epic, but it's pretty fine and funny, I enjoyed a lot of stuff, the characters are awesome! Even Steppenwolf isn't the lame they said, he is just not memorable, he's OK, a generic villain who delivers what everyone should expect (come on, it's Steppenwolf, why would you guys expect a mind blower villain here?) The plot is simple and works. The only fatal flaw for a huge fan of DC is the return of Superman, damn, that's was sooo weird :/ And Zimmer would be so much better than Danny was, buuut there's nothing we can do about it now, at least it's nostalgic."", 'First of all, I\'m a huge DC fanboy and I was so excited to wait to watch the movie as soon as it on air. So after 2hs watching the movie, I have to say that I\'m so disappointed with this JL movie.Even I\'m a fan who read the comic and watched all the cartoon of JL, none of them can make me feel this worse than this movie. Everything was a mess, Batman was like an emotional girl and Superman was like a teenager with the superpower who can kill the boss with one punch.I doubt that WB made the Production team cut so many scenes of the the movie like what they did on BvS before.Now I will wait and watch again this movie in HD if they have an ""uncut"" one. But if they really have one, I will have to say this to WB: ""shame, shame of you WB, don\'t do sh*t with DC anymore and we want justice for Justice League""', 'Funny that at least half of these positive reviews were made by a week-old,fresh accounts.These ""fans"" will always get mediocre movies as long as they protect them.Anyway,this is the 4th time of DCappointment.(w.woman was good). DC has officially become MCU 2.0.DC fans are criticizing MCU movies for obvious reasons.Yet they praise J.league even though it is just like a typical marvel/MCU movie. DC has become the very thing that DC fans hate and criticized over years. Villain was so weak,flash and aquaman were cringe(especially flash),pacing was so fast. The comedy was so forced and jokes were bad placed. Some people thought that they should make flash,cyborg,aquaman solo movies before the JL in order to develop the characters.And those people were absolutely correct.Those 3 characters really lacks development. DC is still making tons of mistakes in movie industry.I think they really need to reconsider the future of dc movies.', ""Finally the Justice League movie has arrived. Some of us have waited all of our lives for this film, but is it any good?Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Cieran Hinds, Jason Mamoa, Ezra Miller, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons and J.K. Simmons. The story picks up where Batman V Superman left us. After the death of Superman the world has descended into chaos, but it's only the beginning. An alien invasion is on it's way led by the ruthless Steppenwolf. Now our heroes must put their differences aside and work together to save the planet!It's well known that this film had a very difficult production. Zack Snyder had to step down do to a family tragedy and Joss Whedon took over and did some rewrites and shot extra scenes. One of my biggest fears going into this film was that it would feel like to different movies into one. With to different directors with each there distinct style it definitely was a risk, but i would say that it's not the case. Justice League feels like it's one director's vision, luckily. But still this film suffers from a lot of problems. If you have been following my account for a while you will know that Justice League is one of my most anticipated films of the year. I also liked most of the other DCEU films, but sadly Justice League is a step down in my opinion. My main complaint and the biggest issue with it is that it feels very rushed in it's storytelling. A lot of conflicts are set up extremely quickly and therefor you don't feel the emotion that clearly was intended from the director. The rumor going around is that Warner Bros. mandated the films 2 hour run time, and in a lot of instances it feels like something is missing. Even whole scenes feels like they are missing. Also the CGI in this film Sometimes looks very bad and this takes you out of the movie sadly. These are the main complaints i have. As for the positives there are still a lot of great things here. The new characters of Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg are all portrayed very well and, though rushed, compelling characters. Especially Ezra Miller's Flash provides a lot of the humor. This is another good thing for some. Surprisingly Batman delivers a lot of the humor and i think it suite his character in this film. Justice League is a quite funny film and much more lighthearted than previous installments of this franchise. Sometimes though this becomes too much as the films lacks the seriousness that films like Wonder Woman had. The film is definitely best in the first half. I think the death of Superman is handled very well in the first act. The team dynamic is also a clear positive. The members have interesting arguments and conversations that we didn't get enough of. And when the team is United and start fighting, it's exciting for any fan to watch! To sum up my thoughts Justice League is overall a disappointment. It feels rushed in almost every way and the story and film as a whole suffers from it. Also Steppenwolf as the villain feels like your everyday disposable Marvel villain like Malekith. There still are good things to see in this film and while watching i was entertained, but Justice League should have been much better. The first time this legendary team is on screen should have been an epic moment but it wasn't. Sadly.Final rating: 6/10"", 'I wasn\'t too sure about \'Justice League\', but was assured that it was the sort of movie we liked, so off we toddled. There are clearly gaps in our knowledge of super hero recent events. Mebbe they were on Fox. Anyway, Superman is dead! How the hell did THAT happen? Who is Cyborg? When did Khal Drogo eschew the steppe for the deep?The earth is under attack. No surprises there. This time it\'s Steppenwolf and a host of dodgy CGI\'s. Steppenwolf looks to be your standard or garden earth imperiler. I don\'t know why he is called Steppenwolf. Hermann Hesse might. Dunno. Haven\'t read it.. Logic would indicate that it was to segue into ""Born to be Wild\' but it didn\'t and the movie is the poorer for it.Steppenwolf is looking for three mystic boxes to put together to bring something that might be his mother back to rule the universe. I think. One was held by the Amazons, one by the Atlanteans, and one by a Russian farmer with a shotgun. Batman sets about putting together a team to defeat Steppenwolf. There is Aquaman, Cyborg, the Flash and Wonder Woman. But the Wolfster can go a bit and they are overmatched. To be fair, it\'s hardly your superhero \'A\' team. They decide to bring Superman back from the dead. As you do. I thought that it was lucky that he hadn\'t been cremated then slapped myself for my stupidity.Superman is bought back from the dead! It was my fervent hope that he \'S\' on the outfit would be changed into a \'Z\' and his vocabulary would have been reduced to one word; and that word would be \'Brains\' but alas, the \'Doom of ZombieMan\' was to be a dream unrequited. It starts off promisingly enough with Superman being confused and very cross about recent events and generally smiting hither and thither but Lois Lane turns up and he, Superman, rogers her and gets over his temporary death and subsequent resurrection. The Justice League, now with Superman coming off the bench, set about saving the world. Is it any good?Nope. It\'s crap. Think \'Interstellar\' in tights. The two people sitting next to us were drunk (at 10.00am; well done you!) and they clearly enjoyed it. We weren\'t and we didn\'t.Would\'ve been improved by;1. Superman being reborn as one of the living dead 2. \'Born to be Wild\' 3. Daenerys Targaryen 4. Being drunk', ""I grew up with DC and JLA (and Superfriends). Gal Gadot is perfect and WB got Wonder Woman 'right'. But she can't save this film. it's just dull. If you are going to spend your money, go spend it on Thor Ragnarok - it's visually more impressive and has an actual plot that you can invest yourself in; Justice League's plot doesn't have any hooks to latch onto, and while we love the characters, and the cast has finally been well thought out, with the exception of Wonder Woman the costumes are still a failure and the story is all over the map making little sense and not allowing for any emotional investment in any character other than Superman - whose roll has nothing to do with the threat at hand or the history of it. Go see Thor."", ""One year and 7 months since BvS, the Trinity is back with additional members. A half-man half-robot guy, a man who can talk to fish, and a man who can only push something when he is running. First, let's talk about each member character's development except the Trinity. First is Aquaman. Because of his role is somehow important in this movie, he's got a lot of background story. Can't explain more because there is a spoiler on it. Next is Cyborg. He has similar portion with the man who uses fork to fight. However, he has a significant role for the movie. Last is Barry Allen. The movie brings premise to Flash movie in the next year. Overall, it is great.Move to the plot. Personally, I do find it fast-paced :( Maybe it is true that Zack Snyder is lack on delivering the story. Up until now, it bothers me why Warner Bros used this kind of plot to bring the league. Nevertheless, I was delightful to see the action scenes. The first last battle makes me shivers.Conclusion's time! Justice League is a nice-packed of several action scenes movie. I would say that this movie is a jumping stone for their next crossover because of its lack essence of the story. For fanboys, there are lot of hints that you can find in the movie. It pleases your thirst, I mean hunger, for comic book references. The score is 8 of 10. (If it is seen by the action, I would definitely give it 9)' P.S : There are two post end credit scenes. To be honest, the last credit scene almost make me lost my mind on DC Cinematic Universe. Totally love it."", 'Well, once again we have the generic, boilerplate, superhero team flick. Team spends the first part of the movie unable to be a team. Then they finally and miraculously get it together just in time to fight the latest unstoppable big bad, who plans to destroy the city/country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe. I\'m Shocked! Shocked I Say, that they pull together and pull though just enough and we find out the city/ country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe is safe until the next, even bigger bad, who is waiting their turn patiently to rain down destruction when the next installment drops in two years.At least this episode had a few obviously Whedonesque quipisms to drop into the tedium between the deadly dull plodding throughline Zack Snyder had deathmarched the audience into, but it was not enough to save us or the movie. I honestly felt like some of our protagonists should have been checking their watches an hour into the movie and asking, ""Can we go beat the bad guy already?"" I am tired of this movie. I was tired of this movie when I saw this movie three movies ago.']",/posters/xJustice.jpg
The Strangers: Prey at NightÂ (2018) ,(2018),5.3,1h 25min,['Horror'],R,"The Strangers: Prey at Night
        is a movie        starring
            Christina Hendricks,            Martin Henderson,             and Bailee Madison.
 A family of four staying at a secluded mobile home park for the night are stalked and then hunted by three masked psychopaths.",Johannes Roberts,Bryan Bertino,"['Christina Hendricks,', 'Martin Henderson,', 'Bailee Madison']","[""About a week or so ago my girlfriend and I watched the first Strangers movie and remembered again that it's actually a pretty good movie and has it's scary moments in it. So then we realize the second one is in theaters and decided to go see that a couple days ago. I didn't check the ratings on it before going, but now I wish I would've. My girlfriend expected to be scared throughout the movie, but soon after it began we ended up trying to hold back laughter through the entire movie due to the ridiculousness of it. Not one part that was supposed to be scary was scary, instead we're just laughing. Now for some examples of what we found ridiculous..How the actors and actresses in this movie have not one ounce of survival instincts kicking in, especially in cases where it's 2 on 1 and they just basically accept their fate. Every single member of the family leaves their phones behind as they leave their trailer in an unfamiliar area with nobody else around.. As the brother and sister are running though this big trailer park area with a number of options of places to hide in and run to, one of the three strangers just knows exactly where the kids are going to go to. These strangers can see into the future or something, otherwise I don't know how they can put themselves into every trailer or crevice that these kids running for their lives end up trying to hide in. The girl who comes and knocks on the door at first gets blasted close range in the chest with a shotgun, and miraculously needs a second shot to finally die. Masked man rams into the back of this police SUV the daughter is in, disabling the SUV while his old truck runs like new with the front end being smashed in. The man with the mask is in his truck, which explodes in a huge fire, and continues driving said flaming truck after the daughter. Then he gets out and is able to walk swinging his axe, all without screaming hysterically as his entire body is singed in third degree burns.If there's anything I learned from this movie, it's that the model of truck the strangers drive is an indestructible piece of machinery and should be used by the army in place of the Humvee."", ""The mother basically surrenders to Dollface, someone she could easily have tried to at least kick before letting her stab her multiple times for no reason. The father crashes the car into a wall only to be punctured in the stomach and that's it? Nothing that made the original memorable was present here. Instead, the usual horror cliches are plenty. Goth chick with no reason to hate the world? Check. Cop that gets shot as soon as final girl asks for help? Check. A main killer with superhero strength? Check. Radio/phone that's on loud speaker so it leads to a noise outside announcing the killer has heard them? Check. 80s songs devoid of any real connection to the plot thrown in constantly just to be trendy? Check. Cars on fire crashing and roaming empty streets where absolutely not a single soul spots the ongoing chaos? The trailer park isn't just abandoned, it's zombie-apocalypse abandoned - and it's gigantic. Did I mention not a SINGLE car drives by the entire night, on that gigantic radius, with the exception of said cop who, clearly, gets hits throat slashed the second he gets out of the car. The original was an exercise in atmospheric horror: you felt as if you were there, inside that cabin. You also rooted for the main couple because their story felt genuine. This is, unfortunately, a dud."", 'If you like movies where characters make cringeworthy irrational decisions, this is the one for you. From not leaving the camp when they should to hiding in a tube instead of running, this movie has it all. I do give props to the killers though, they seemingly knew where everyone was at all times and even where they were going to be. This review is a warning to all, just skip the film or waste your time.P.s.\nThe first Strangers was much better than this.', 'Girlfriend made me watch this with her... now im single,', ""Overall very exciting with good acting, light and background music.The plot however is horrible. That is why I was very captivated during the first half and nearly bored at the second half. The whole story line is based on the same type of jump-scares, always danger jumping out of the dark, and after a time it became way too predictable and ridiculous.In conclusion I would say it's a movie for watching once when you are bored but certainly not a movie to watch a second time."", ""The music is the best part of the movie. I loved the 80s themed soundtrack, especially during the pool scene. The movie slowly ramps up tension and when it hits full bore it never stops. Its relenting. The characters do stupid things of course, but that's par for the course for these movies. In the end you do care enough to want them to survive . I admit the film doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but what it does bring it does really well. I'd recommend to fans of the slasher genre and of the original movie."", 'In 2008 a movie called ""The Strangers"" was released, which, in my opinion, is one of the best horror movies of recent times, mainly because of its simplicity and its eerie realism. So here we are, a decade later, with the release of its sequel, titled ""The Strangers: Prey At Night"", directed by Johannes Roberts. Given the success of the first installment, it\'s fair to assume that this sequel comes with a lot of hype even after all these years. Unfortunately, not only does ""Prey At Night"" not live up to the hype, it comes up far short of it. \nPrey At Night\'s plot will be familiar to anyone that has seen the first movie. A family decides to go away for the weekend and stay at a trailer park where some family members live at. Soon after they arrive, they get a knock from a mysterious girl who is seemingly lost. After she leaves, the family begins noticing strange things and soon encounter three masked people trying to hunt down and kill them. Again, it\'s a story that will be familiar to anyone that has seen the original, but this time it\'s a family of four trying to survive in a trailer park seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Because it\'s set in the confines of a trailer park and not a house like in the original, there\'s a lot more room for the family to move around and escape from these masked killers. Ultimately, in this case, that ends up being a bad thing. What really made the original as eerie and intense as it was is how condensed the atmosphere was. It was two people essentially trapped in an isolated house with nothing else around them while being stalked and preyed upon by three unknown, masked people. It really added to the chill that you felt by watching it knowing that there is a bit of realism that is present in the situation. It was simple but very effective in how it delivered its scares. Here, it\'s different. It\'s a much more open and less suffocating atmosphere and as a result, you lose a lot of the tenseness and eeriness that existed in the original. What I\'m trying to say here is that this movie is not very scary. It has its moments here and there, but the constant feeling of dread that was in the original is unfortunately absent here due to the structure of the environment.\nAnother element of the original that makes it better is the performances. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman really made you feel like they were in grave danger, which added to the overall feeling of dread. In this sequel, the acting isn\'t quite as good. It\'s still an ""okay"" cast made up of Christina Hendricks, Martin Henderson, Bailee Madison (probably the standout here), and Lewis Pullman, but they\'re just not quite up to par with Tyler and Speedman, both being pretty good actors. To be fair, however, the characters and writing didn\'t necessarily do this new cast any justice. Multiple times throughout the movie these people would do idiotic things that would get them into trouble. If I had a nickel for every time I wanted to facepalm, I\'d probably have enough to easily cover my ticket for the movie. And don\'t even get me started on the last 15 minutes. Most of the things that happen in the final 15 minutes is either so idiotic that I could barely watch, or not even humanly possible. It\'s all just a bunch of nonsense that tries to set up a sequel, but fails miserably. \nThe film\'s runtime is 85 minutes, which is pretty short for a mainstream movie these days. It ends up being a good thing though, as the movie doesn\'t waste much time getting straight to the action. Instead of a drawn out, overlong horror flick, it ends up being pretty well paced, which is one of the few things that it actually gets right. \nOverall, what we have here is a horror sequel that pales in comparison in every way to the original. It tries to be as scary and thrilling as the original, but what the original had was simplicity and realism, which created a constant feeling of dread, something that this movie fails to deliver even in its best moments. Here\'s hoping that it takes them 10 years to deliver another sequel.', ""This movie really sucked bad. I can't believe it's rated 4 points higher than Wrinkle either. In 2008 I was rooting for Liv Tyler to somehow survive the horror. But in this one, after 30 minutes of bad acting I was rooting for the Creeps to hurry up and finish off this family so I could leave. But no, they had to drag it out for another hour. What were they doing out there in the dark all that time anyway? At least we find out the family's last name. The Spineless family. And no middle class Cincinnati family would be driving a crappy 25 year old minivan like that."", 'So many plot holes. Cheesy ending, and no attempt to be scary', 'The acting was not exceptional. The plotting was not exceptional. The dialogue was definitely not exceptional. Characters regularly made decisions running counter to even a modicum of common sense. It was dumb. It was so dumb. Just watch the original again instead.', 'This is just...not a great movie. There is zero character development so you can\'t exactly feel much for the characters. The amount of times throughout the movie that I just sat there thinking ""why is this happening"" because what I was seeing was either absolutely confusing or just downright ridiculous. The sound track wasn\'t too bad though.', ""After seeing 'The Strangers' as an impressionable preteen back in 2008, I quickly became one of the many fans desperate to see the masked villains resurface in a sequel. When I heard 'Prey at Night' was set to be released early 2018 (with an original screenplay from Bryan Bertino himself!) I was over the moon. I wanted to experience the unique and terrifyingly real atmosphere of the first film reimagined. Instead, I got an overly cliched, embarrassing, tonally inconsistent, overacted, repetitive and boring ... 80s homage. \nTo even call 'Prey at Night' a sequel to the original film feels forced and unnatural. The only thing which binds the two films together are the Strangers themselves, and even then the correlation is pretty weak. This film fails to capture any of the isolation and despair found in the original, and alternatively hammers the audience over the head with crappy exposition and character development. None of the interactions between the 'family members' felt genuine. 'Hello little sister, I am your big brother. Remember that very specific thing that happened when we were younger? Of course you do, let's go ahead and recount it so the audience knows how close we are and how much we love each other'. Having characters spout out generic and stale anecdotes does not make them more personable or authentic. \nThe Strangers survive things that no human being is capable of surviving. Elevating normal, human killers in horror films to superhero level completely erases any tension or potential stakes. Bailee Madison is possibly the least convincing 'rebellious teen' in all of cinematic history. Christina Hendricks was weirdly obnoxious and too young to be playing a mother of teenagers. Martin Henderson read his lines. Lewis Pullman was just kind of there. Sadly, this film is just not worth the time. Not even for a laugh."", ""I almost didn't watch this movie based on previous user reviews. Whew, I am so happy I went with the few that loved it, as I did! I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. I loved the original and felt the sequel was just as good as the first! Atmospheric and tense tone, paced well, and some surprises I did not expect (that did not happen in the original). If you are a fan of the first, you will certainly enjoy this treat! The movie has an 80's throwback theme that I found nostalgic."", 'This movie was a waste of time. Not money, but time. When everybody left their phone in the trailer home, I realized this was gonna be a hell of a crappy movie.', ""What a disgusting followup to a great movie. The whiny little girl crying over everything reminds me how kids these days don't give a F about their parents or their siblings and only care about me me me me. I hated this movie, and the ending was even worse than the bad parts of the movie. \nThe story is good, they stop overnight somewhere but so dumb that the entire place is abandoned because its after Labor Day? Dumb dumb dumb.\nStay away"", 'If you\'re go see this because you loved the first installation, you\'re not alone. I had hesitation that it might be bad, but I still had to give it a shot. The first movie has been one of my favorites over the last ten years. The intensity, the mostly silent atmosphere (creating an actual uncomfortable but adrenaline pumping viewing), the way the actors/actresses actually make you believe this was real....all these made the original a phenomenal movie.Prey At Night shatters all of these. They added a lot of 80\'s style music (and sometimes, that\'s really cool. Take ""It Follows"" for instance...but not for a movie where the silence MAKES it scary). The actors/actresses have a horrendous script to follow. And the intensity just isn\'t there...unless Scream is the scariest slasher you\'ve ever seen.Spoilers....\nHow in the hell does a truck continue to chase someone down after it\'s blown up and is on fire?\nHow do three masked killers transport from place to place in this trailer park, being in multiple places, scene after scene?\nHow does a kid get stabbed in the back, bleed out in a pool, then get pulled from the pool like he\'s not THAT hurt, and ultimately survives after being left to bleed out? \nThese psychopaths get off on stalking and killing people at random with no motive....but since when did they completely mutilate and sculp their victims faces? The aunt and uncle were skinned and jaw ripped open, etc. Then being dead on the bed or floor with blood everywhere would\'ve been just fine. \nAll three killers die, yet they end it with a cliffhanger for another possible movie? These are just a small amount of the inconsistencies in this movie. Not worth your money. Just throw in the original, make a bag of popcorn, and enjoy a cheap night in on the couch.', ""I went into this as usual with no expectations as I loved the first one but didn't want to base my opinions of this based off of the first one but I was pleasantly suprised.

The characters weren't the selling point but I'd still reccomend this film to any horror fan or any movie gore wanting a decent watch."", ""Very very bad. The worst part is when the boy gets a chance to shoot the masked woman in self defense .. but no he doesn't !\nIf you live horror movies, do not watch this stupid movie"", 'Keep in mind this is only my opinion. ****warning mild spoilers ahead but not really***The second Strangers film trades the original\'s suspense and tension for in your face horror clichÃ©s. Tripping damsels in distress, seemingly super human, hard to kill psychos (ala\' Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers) and far more gore. My favorite part of the first film was not knowing what was going on and what to expect. Not knowing anything at all about the strangers, then having them simply leave at the end to kill again. I didn\'t want to see a film where the strangers are unmasked and or killed or reduced to b movie psychopaths. As my subject saysThe film ""Open House"" is a far better sequel to the Strangers.', ""This is beyond amazing for a sequel. I was so impressed with it all. The beginning was a little slow but that was the case for the original too. The music is perfect. The cinematography. The acting of the kids! My absolute new favorite slasher!

Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been.

It's a great film. I'd recommend it to everybody. Don't listen to the useless critics and pointless user reviewers with super over the top movie standards.

Lots of laughs! There are the generic breast and penis jokes, lots of butt and boob close ups, but also genuine hilarity. The men and women at my movie theater couldn't stop laughing. In fact, I had to cover my mouth several times from laughing TOO loudly. There are moments of warmth, lessons to be learned, and a lot of Zac Efron's abs. With the amount of ladies' butts shown in this movie, it rivals the latest Fast and Furious movie.

Throughout the film there is lots of action which is exciting and all the actors and actresses do an excellent job!

This is the 3rd take on the character in less then 20 years and the trailers did not convince me, but since I love Tom Holland's work and finally Spider-Man would be in the MCU, it was logical that I had to watch the movie.Surprised, positively surprised, amazed, there is nothing I don't like in this movie, the simplicity of it it's unbelievable, it's so grounded, even though the core of the film is sci-fi and all, it's impossible to believe in what you just watched. The characters are interesting, even the annoying Flash...maybe...moving on, Tom Holland was born to wear the title Spider-Man, even tough I liked Tobie Maguire's take on the characters and Andrew's Garfield as well, in just one movie Tom Holland have already stand out in an amazing way, since Civil War, actually, but I waited for his own movie to get an actual and reliable source to spoke my opinion.

Not only because of the consistency with the comics, but also because it clearly showed us how Spider-Man is not just the suit. It\'s the man wearing it. Just like Tony said, ""If you\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\'t have it."" Really loved the scene when he realises what Tony meant by that and rose up from the ""ashes"" (rubbles to be more specific). A great redeeming moment for the kid and the man he became. Further, this movie keeps the series open to so many possibilities since some of the characters shown in the movie have had important roles in comics. Don\'t want to mention them here but there are more than five.In the end, I think the MCU has finally given Spider-Man the movie he deserves and he has now come back home to Marvel. Can\'t wait to see him in the Infiniity War. Oh YEAH!!', 'Great Movie, a lot of scenes filmed in my neighborhood highly recommend Blu Ray release. All star cast except for PP himself, still up and coming star, but great start to a very promising career Tom Holland. I love Micheal Keaton as the main bad guy Vulture. Just a bit confused as to where this movie takes place as far as Tobey and Andrew versions. Is it after both of their versions or somewhere in between.', 'After reading several different negative reviews, there seemed to be a lot of people complaining about some of the same ""issues"", but they all seem to miss the point of this movie, and the reasoning why writers do certain things differently. I have been a Spider-Man fan for over 10 years, and I enjoyed the Raimi and Webb films very much.People have complained quite a bit about how Peter Parker was portrayed throughout the film as selfish and his acts as Spider-Man were only done so he could become an Avenger, and for a portion of the film, this is correct, but it is not a terrible thing. Peter is 15-years old in this movie, he is a kid, and he of course is not very mature yet though he is very intelligent (he made the web shooters, answered questions correctly in class without having to pay attention, etc.) In a world where the Avengers are all over the news, of course a kid with super abilities dreams of being in the Avengers, and that is his motivation throughout most of the film. Peter has had his abilities for less than a year so he is still learning the ropes, thus why he is so destructive during the van chase scene. While many people complain that ""this is not how Spider-Man should be"", they seem to miss the part where the switch in Peter\'s head is flipped. The scene when the Vulture covered Peter in the rubble and he had to struggle to get out, he realized how strong he truly is, and that being a hero is not about being a ""cool"" Avenger, and that is not easy. This is when Peter truly became Spider-Man, this is when Peter cared more about stopping the Vulture because he is a dangerous threat, and not because it would make Tony happy. For the first time, Peter stopped thinking about himself, and that is when he became a true hero. This is reiterated when Tony offers Peter a spot with the Avengers and he turns Tony down. He wants to save lives, and be a real hero before he can be an Avenger.The high-tech suit is one of the most complained about aspects of this movie. Personally, I think this suit is a perfect way to integrate Spider-Man into the MCU. It makes perfect sense that if Tony Stark is going to take a 15-year old kid under his wing, that he would give him some of the similar technology that he currently uses. The moving eyes feature is one of my favorites, mostly because within the comic books, the illustrators used Spider-Man\'s eyes to express emotion while within the suit, whereas in the Raimi trilogy, and in The Amazing Spider-Man series, Spider-Man\'s eyes could not move on the suit, so to show emotion, his mask would have to be ripped off his face. The moving eyes technology is a logical way to allow Spider-Man to show emotion while in the suit. Also, the AI (Karen) was also complained about a lot. Again, referring to the comic books, Peter talked to himself a lot, or at least thought a lot while in the suit. The AI creates a logical reason for Peter to talk to himself while running around as Spider-Man without looking like a psychopath.Besides this, many people were complaining about the character changes. Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) is complained about because he is a ""small Indian kid"", first, he is Guatemalan, not Indian. Flash was portrayed in a very similar way in the Raimi and Webb series\', it was time for Flash to be changed. In 2017, bullies are not just physical bullies anymore, they are verbal/mental bullies that prey on insecurities, and this makes a lot of sense for Flash to be this type of bully within the context of the film. A ""dumb jock"" type bully does not fit into the mold of someone who attends ""Midtown School of Science and Technology"". Flash hurts Peter\'s reputation, and makes him feel like an outcast, but the scene at the bus when Peter asks to rejoin the academic decathlon team and Flash walks towards him, Peter backs away from Flash as if he feels intimidated by him. Though Flash is not a huge guy, either is Peter, so up until Peter received his abilities, Flash was probably able to push Peter around.Another obvious character who was changed in this movie was Aunt May, but I think this is for the better. Aunt May, portrayed by Marisa Tomei is not as young as people make her out to be, she is 52-years old and though she is not 80+ like in the Raimi trilogy, this makes more sense that a 52-year old woman would have a 15-year old nephew. Plus, this gives Peter and his aunt more of a mother and son dynamic, and considering Peter\'s parents died when he was young and Aunt May and Uncle Ben raised Peter, having her seem as a younger motherly figure as opposed to a grandmother figure makes more sense for the story.The Michelle ""MJ"" Easter-egg was taken too literally. Michelle could be a potential love interest for Peter, but she is not Mary Jane, the writers as well as Zendaya have confirmed this. The MJ name drop was done as an Easter-egg, not as a serious character introduction.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was not perfect, but this was a great film to explain how Peter went from being an excited kid in a costume trying to impress Tony, to becoming a true hero. The humor was fantastic, the cast seemed to have true chemistry together, it was aesthetically pleasing, the soundtrack was catchy, the Vulture was one of the best MCU villains to date, and I am very excited to see what else Marvel does with the character.', 'An American feature film of 2017 directed by John Watts with Tom Holland and Michael Keaton in the lead roles. The script is based on comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko of Marvel Comics. World premiere of the picture took place on June 28, 2017 in Hollywood.\nThe action takes place a few months after the events described in the film ""The First Avenger: Confrontation."" According to the story, Peter Parker is trying to find a balance between school life and to be a Spider-Man, while facing the Vulture.\nThe best thing about the film is the script (written by John Watts), which is fast and funny. The music\'s cool. The performances are great.\nWould I recommended the film? Yes, I would. It\'s one of the most interesting comedies I\'ve seen in recent years!\nReview by Ira, 14, Voronezh', ""It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie."", ""First of all, I could not recognize Michael Keaton as Adrian during viewing this film. Actually I surprised everybody is getting old without clear notice... American comic style differs from Japanese one. And I'm quite familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's animations. Although I have allergy to see American comic films, I really love this one! This is a kind of story that a super hero who is hiding his true identity and mission lives normally student life of his own. Only an incident happens, he becomes a hero to deal with villains. And villains are searching his whereabouts for revenge. A kind of student version of Bat man. The most interesting plot is Peter's girl friend's father is the antagonist, Adrian! The action line and emotional line of story are perfectly combined into one at the end of Act 2. The result of the battle is Peter=Spiderman wins over the antagonist. And the filmmaker did not have Adrian survive. I think it is too realistic, and everyone wants Adrian do not die as a father of Pete's girl friend. Anyway, the entire expression of film art is perfect!"", ""Not only does this continue Marvel's streak of fun, light-hearted action, it perfectly captures the high school environment and the personality of a teenage superhero who strives to help others, struggles to keep his identity a secret, and wants to lead a normal high school kid's life more than anything. the story is fun, engaging, emotional, and unexpected. the villain character was well-developed, none of the clichÃ© characters we're used to from old spiderman movies, the love interest was perfectly handled, nothing too cringy or over dramatic, basically what you'd expect from a marvel movie and more. i can't think of anything they could've changed to make me like this movie better, and for that i give it a 10"", 'Good story, good character development, awesome fight scenes and a lot of suspense!', 'I\'m a huge fan of SpiderMan. I was grown up with this hero\'s movies, animated television, etc. I\'m the one who always likes Peter\'s invention. I think many of you might think like me about his suit. It seemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn\'t helping Peter with his tech support but if you watch this movie and open your mind. you\'ll understand what he wants to prove himself like as Tony said ""If you\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\'t have it."" So In my opinion it\'s this version that finally puts a truly portrayal of #PeterParker. Tom did great job. I love it.I\'ve watched it in three projection systems. In my personal opinion 4DX is kind of exhausting.. but it would be more fun if you see it in the normal screen or IMAX first. I always prefer #IMAX as it enhances my movie going experience. Moreover, I\'ve seen Peter\'s face on big screen with full of my eye.', ""You should definitely watch if you are a true fan of Spider-Man and Marvel. Tom Holland revived Peter Parker as a new. Michael Keaton's portrayal as Vulture was very good.There is no doubt that Tobey Maguire was a better actor. But if we give Holland more time than I hope that he will nail it with his performance. :)"", ""Really great movie and cast really enjoyed the movie but i wanted to see him training with his suit more. To see him go through all the different abilities his suit had would've been fun if we could've seen him learning them it would be perfect for me. I felt like the villain was a little sloppy because i didn't really feel the danger as you would with other more evil villains. I don't think Michael Keaton did a bad job i just think his role wasn't the best.\nBut that was the things i didn't like EVERYTHING else about the movie i really liked. The performance by Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and Zendaya was really good it wouldn't have been the same with someone else.\nI recommend this movie i think it was great!"", 'I was a bit over Spiderman but my son lent me Spider-Man:Homecoming and Captain America: Civil War on Blu-ray. I was blown away by the new younger Spiderman, the blockbuster action and the special affects. A fast paced storyline with plenty of action and humour. I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as the somewhat evil yet sympathetic villain. Tom Holland brought a new freshness to the character of Spider-Man. I love Marisa Tomei but why did they make her look a lot hotter in Captain America: Civil War and then toned down her looks in Spider-Man: Homecoming? A very enjoyable and entertaining movie.', ""This is the best Spider-man among all those earlier versions! It's just give the spidey vibe based from the original media - comics!"", ""Spider-Man Homecoming is a magnificent movie. Tom Holland is the new actor of the movie. The film is very funny and interesting. It is about Spider-Man trying to prove his spot on the Avengers team.

Reasons that it was good was one, it was very funny two, there wasn't any background story which the author said took a very long time and three, it includes a little bit of Iron- Man.According to RottenTomatoes.com, 88 percent liked it and the movie's average rating is 4.2 out of 5 which is a really good rating.

When I watched the movie , I let out a laugh one or twice.Spider-Man Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie I saw, It was funny and other people liked the movie too. I hope you watch this spectacular movie."", 'Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we\'ve taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of \'Dancing Emo Peter\' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we\'ve watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers\' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it\'s immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts\' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it\'s nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film\'s stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It\'s a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker\'s bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it\'s hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It\'s telling that we know and care more about Parker\'s high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film\'s comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film\'s grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU\'s macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker\'s teacher deadpans ""or maybe he\'s a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming \'world-building,\' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts\' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker\'s unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume\'s wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film\'s biggest laughs (two words: \'Intimidation Mode\'), while Michael Giacchino\'s twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton\'s Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton\'s idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant \'working class hero\' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover\'s cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film\'s relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core \'tireless underdog\' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he\'s almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy \'Uncle Tony\' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn\'t just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He\'s home. -9.5/10', ""Honestly, when the movie was announced I really did think that this would've ruined the classic Spiderman franchise, seems that I was wrong. This is an absolutely 'amazing' movie, best Spiderman movie yet! Although actors have changed, this time the Avengers recognise this young man as a hero and they also add a story to it, the classic Spiderman trying to stop the train with the tensile strength of his webs was recreated in the movie and many of the original features were retained. There is also a very funny sense of humour (personally) and I honestly found it hilarious. They could not choose anyone better than Ned as Spidey's best friend and I would rate this movie an excellent 9.6 out of 10!""]",/posters/xSpider-Man:.jpg

With practically training whatsoever she can take on Luke and Kylo and win.Snoke is magical. He appeared out of nowhere in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi has such fantastic Force powers (never before seen in the entire Star Wars Universe) and yet can\'t tell when his protege is scheming to slice him in two (but could fell his every throught earlier, and even manipulate him and Rey\'s thoughts and get them to intergalactically Skype each other and even send water through space).Luke is magical. He can magically project himself light years away and even bring solid things (the lucky dice) with him. Then dies magically for no apparent reason.Yoda is magical. His Force-ghost actually has more Force powers than when he was alive! Calling down lightning from the sky??? Heck, why don\'t the Jedi just do that when fighting on Tattooine or whatever? And if Force-ghosts still have Force powers why not the whole gang of Anakin, Ben and Yoda take on Snoke?Rose is magical. She appears out of nowhere and just happens to go along with Finn on a completely unnecessary mission to find a code breaker, and find not one but TWO code breakers, one of which is in the SAME CELL as they are. I mean, is that magical or what?Leia is magical. Previously in 7 movies only having the barest abilities in the Force, she now can survive in space for quite a long time and even open her eyes without getting them immediately frozen, and Force-Mary Poppins herself back to the space ship. Magical!I could go on and on. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it\'s one shameless Deus Ex Machina after another. And don\'t even get me started on the stupid feminist nonsense, the inane attempt at comedy, the stupid characters who go nowhere in their characterisation, the stupid casino subplot, the stupid ""saving"" of Finn who wanted to sacrifice himself by Rose who magically now has feeling for him and both of them magically survive without getting shot at by the entire First Order army. Oops, I did go on and on.If you make a movie, you need to make sure your movie stays in the universe it came from. Not invent new rules, new powers, new super villains, new behaviours from old characters, etc. out of bloody nowhere.', 'This didn\'t feel like Star Wars. Now, I know people said that after viewing The Phantom Menace, but the prequels, despite their flaws, delivered a picture of a larger and more complex galaxy than the one we were introduced to in the original trilogy. The prequel characters were poorly written, scene direction felt off at times, Jar Jar existed, but at the end of the day I\'ll take the prequels over the new Disney films because they painted a universe. They made me want to see more Star Wars, and I appreciated the original trilogy\'s story arc even more after watching them. The Last Jedi did the complete opposite. It killed my interest in the Star Wars universe because there seems to be nothing left to care about. The Resistance is just the Rebels. The First Order is just the Empire. No end is in sight. Rey is perfect already. Snoke is dead and no one cared enough to even explain his existence in the first place. The original trilogy might as well just have never happened. We\'ve had three death stars. No stable political structure seems to be possible in the galaxy, and if it were we wouldn\'t visit it in the films. For all we know the conflict could be taking place in one tiny sector of the galaxy with the rest of the galaxy completely out of the loop. Sure, some people in a space casino make money off selling weapons and a slave kid has a Rebellion ring now, but that\'s not enough to establish why I should care about the story anymore. ""They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow.""The humor was cringe-worthy. Even the characters don\'t care. Poe\'s prank-call at the beginning dissolved any anxiety we might feel about his character right out the gate. Star Wars doesn\'t have to take itself seriously 100% of the time, but its characters should feel like they\'re fighting real battles. I don\'t even want to talk about the casino scenes. Disney has no right to lecture us on capitalism. Much of the movie was just scenes lifted from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, cut-and-pasted around in a different order as if we couldn\'t figure that out. I sense a tone of disrespect for viewers\' intelligence. Additionally, it is deeply disturbing to me to see critics give this movie such a high rating and then see news outlets publish articles questioning how seriously we should take the backlash. It is not a flaw in the ratings system. Sure, casual and young viewers will enjoy. But the backlash is real, and it\'s not all crusty old fanboys nostalgic about the good ol\' days and complaining about political agendas (not that the fanboys always have illegitimate arguments). I\'m a twenty-two year old woman and I was very disappointed. Star Wars is for everyone. That should include fans, and people who love good stories.', 'I didn\'t hate TLJ, but even if I completely ignore all the (among many fans) controversial choices Rian Johnson made with regards to his treatement of Star Wars\' lore and characters, I still have a great number of qualms with the film in terms of its storytelling (sorry, this is going to be rather long):PACING: Now that was probably my biggest issue with the film. Apart from the opening battle, the film has very little forward momentum for nearly two thirds of its running time. After the action-heavy beginning, the plot gets tangled in 3 separate storylines which unfold simultaneously. My (perhaps personal) problem was that I found 2 of those neither emotionally involving nor thrilling: the Finn/Rose subplot about finding the code-breaker on the ""Casino Planet"" Canto Bight as well as the Poe/Holdo storyline about the resistance\' messy escape from the First Order and the universe\'s most sluggish space chase. But the one story I was ready to get fully invested in - you know: the one about Rey and Luke on the island (and Kylo via Force-Skype) - not only offers very little in terms of action and visual excitement, it also never really gets the time to breathe: because the overall narrative requires the film to cut back and forth between it and the other two evolving story threads.\n \nThe result of that narrative structure is 90 minutes of scenes with Rey and Luke (and a little Kylo) on a dreary, grey island that beg to resonate emotionally but get blunted each time by the film\'s need to cut to the (for me) somewhat uninvolving action in Finn\'s and Poe\'s part of the universe. And their two storylines lose all sense of urgency because they keep getting interrupted by the scenes on the island with Rey and Luke - which, to make matters worse, develop over several days in the film while Finn\'s and Poe\'s stories unfold over a couple of hours.Due to that uneven structure we end up with a two-and-a-half-hour movie where the most crucial scenes of the story never get enough room to breathe and even feel rushed. It\'s only once all three storylines start coming together during the last third of the film that the film\'s pacing really works for me. But getting there often feels like a chore (and I\'m really not sure a Star Wars film should feel like work).ODD CHARACTER CHOICES: What is the purpose of having Leia in a coma for the better part of the film? Don\'t tell me this is all set up so Kylo thinks she\'s dead: she\'s connected to the Force, and he\'s about as plugged into the Force as one can be; if established Star Wars lore tells us anything, it\'s that Kylo would instantly feel it if his mother died (now that\'s something even a casual fan such as myself knows). So why not use Leia more? Why introduce a completely new character in Laura Dern\'s Admiral Holdo, if she essentially just functions as a stand-in for Leia?Poe Dameron\'s whole arc in the film is about him learning the terrible human cost for stupid, vain heroism, and it\'s with Leia that he clashes, after he\'s sacrificed half the resistance\' fleet in order to take out a single Dreadnought during the film\'s opening battle. And as soon as Leia\'s in a coma, almost the exact same conflict continues with Holdo. Nothing against Admiral Holdo, but it\'s hard to get invested in her character, because we only just met her; from a storytelling point of view, to make Poe\'s arc really resonate and raise the stakes for him (and the audience), it would make much more sense if he rebelled against Leia. Wasting her in a coma instead seems utterly pointless.BIG MOMENTS: Unlike its immediate predecessor, TLJ shuns familiar formula. It\'s not all forward momentum, it\'s not all action - but unfortunately, it fails to provide the audience with an emotionally involving story instead. It may take characters in unexpected directions, but most of those new directions turn out to be somewhat... rather ""mature"" choices in terms of storytelling instead of exciting ones? Yes, there are several grand moments in the film that work great on an intellectual level, but they fail to reach us on a gut level. Whenever the film tries to build up to a big emotional moment, that moment ends up feeling, well, not very big at all - which naturally could again be a very deliberate choice by the director to subvert the formula, but to what end? Surely, the subversion itself can\'t be his main goal?For example, take the scene where Rey learns from Kylo that her parents were nobodies and that they\'re long dead. The problem of that scene is not the reveal itself: it\'s the scene\'s execution. It\'s a huge reveal for Rey, and it should have more weight. It could - and probably should - be the most emotional moment in the film; a heart-felt gut-punch to our heroine, but instead it\'s just: *fighting* - ""Your parents were nobodies, and they\'re dead."" - ""Yes, I feel it too."" - *fighting continues*. I just don\'t get why such an important moment is treated so fleetingly.In contrast, look how Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams staged The Force Awaken\'s most emotional scene: Han Solo\'s death at the hands of his own, terribly conflicted son. Now you can say about the film itself what you want, but that scene had a huge emotional impact on the viewer. It had weight. Imagine that scene had just happened during a fight, in a heated moment, only for the narrative to proceed without giving it any room? These are storytelling choices by Rian Johnson that don\'t do the movie any favors. I would have been ready to applaud the director\'s (and/or Disney\'s) decision to try something different after TFA, but I lament this failure to develop emotional gravitas - and the film\'s unwillingness to ever raise the stakes for its lead characters. Until the very end, I never feel like any of the protagonists are in real danger. Nor are they ever confronted with the shocking consequences of their reckless actions on a personal level; Finn and Poe\'s great ideas and plans directly lead to the senseless deaths of dozens, if not hundreds of people - but those casualties are just numbers; they\'re just exploding spaceships we witness from afar; our heroes (and we as an audience) are never forced to feel the full weight of their loss.As a consequence, there\'s just nothing there to make this war\'s terrible cost really resonate with us. This film needs a heartfelt punch to the gut; I\'m all for challenging the protagonists morally and give them intellectually satisfying arcs, but the resulting storylines should still be exciting enough to make your heart pound. And I know I can only speak for myself, but my heartbeat hardly ever accelerated throughout its entire two-and-a-half-hour running time - if at all.TLJ\'S ISSUES AS A DIRECT SEQUEL: TFA teased a boatload of things to come, and while I\'m theoretically on board with many of the unexpected directions Rian Johnson took these characters to in TLJ, I am very confused by his decision to ignore so many of the plot threads that were set up by Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams in TFA. Because due to that unorthodox approach, watching those two films back to back is a jarringly weird experience. Regardless how one feels about TFA, not even bothering to acknowledge what came before isn\'t just strange - it\'s almost offending to the many people who were fully invested in its mysteries and could hardly wait for those promised reveals.And don\'t tell me they have only themselves and J.J. Abrams to blame; no - they had every right to have those expectations: because TLJ IS the direct sequel to TFA. In the same sense that BACK TO THE FUTURE II was the direct sequel to BACK TO THE FUTURE: the kind of sequel that continues only seconds after the first film ends, resulting in one unbroken storyline developing over two films. And of course the director can go into unexpected directions in the sequel - hell: as an audience we want him to. In fact, that IS part of our expectation and one of the reasons we go to the movies (and BTTF II did it brilliantly) - but pretending like important plot points and huge moments in the previous film simply didn\'t matter or didn\'t even happen comes dangerously close to playing the audience for fools.Not that an artist (or a huge conglomerate) shouldn\'t have the creative licence to do that - but if you go down that road don\'t act surprised about the inevitable backlash. And I honestly don\'t get why going into new directions had to result in such an uneven transition from the first film to the second; the way I see it, even a couple of lines of dialog from characters like Luke, Snoke or Kylo-Ren would have been enough to tie some of the most prominent lose ends up or at least not just leave them dangling in the air like this. I mean, I get that Johnson doesn\'t want us to be interested in Snoke\'s story (and a whole bunch of other things that were made to feel important in TFA) because HE isn\'t interested in it. But as a writer he could get that point across and still address the issue (because the previous film told the audience to BE interested in it) - just to then quickly resolve it in an offhanded manner and take the story where he wants it to go.SUMMARY: The Last Jedi is a structurally uneven and often frustrating film that almost always refuses to give its heroes - and the audience - satisfaction. It is a film that over large stretches of its running time is so concerned with subverting the formula and teaching lessons about the importance of failure, that it fails to realize how watching your heroes fail over two and a half hours may be unexpected, but frankly - it\'s also a bit tiring.It may have been a gutsy and very unexpected move by Johnson to throw out most of the mysteries teased in TFA, but the question only audiences - and time - can answer is whether what he offers instead is a worthy replacement.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/', 'If Rian Johnson can direct a film then anyone can be a directorIf Kathleen Kennedy can be a producer in Hollywood then any swindler can wheel and deal and become a producerIf Daisy can be an actress and appear in a movie any girl can become an actress and get roles grrrl powerHey why not?\nPersonally, I know this is not Star Wars anymore so I am done with this series and studio', ""I am so sorry that for the first time in my life, I walked out of a Star Wars movie.

This piece of garbage had no character development, horrible edits, basically ruined Luke Skywalker's character and turned him into a hobo. I am so frustrated right now. They've ruined Star Wars."", 'I had relatively high expectations of the Episode VIII. Unfortunately, ""The Last Jedi"" has so many plot holes, inconsistencies, ripoffs from previous movies, annoyingly flat and underdeveloped characters and dialogs, that it deserves many bad reviews that it receives from the public. It could have been so much better...PLOT HOLES and THINGS THAT DOESN\'T MAKE SENSE - examples:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVice Admiral Holdo, for no reason at all, doesn\'t inform Poe and other members of the Resistance about the planet Crait and the escape plan. This creates Poe\'s unnecessary mutiny, just to fill the movie with some unneeded drama and to make cheap ""twist"" when we realize what the Leia\'s and Holdo\'s plan is.BB-8 overpowers and ties 3 prison guards armed with blasters, and muffles their mouths... ALONE.Not enough convincing reasons are shown to explain Skywalker\'s decision to abandon his sister, friends, whole Republic and Resistance, even if they all get killed during his exile. That decision, and the decision to kill Ben, is not in line with Luke\'s character from the previous movies.Why did Luke make a map which shows his location, and then put a map piece in R2 and gave a map piece to Lor San Tekka, if he didn\'t want to be found? Whole story about ""The map to Skywalker"" from Episode VII is now illogical...Not even ONE information about Snoke\'s background, long-term plans, source of his power, etc.? Unbelievable how they wasted that character....Water ends up on Kylo\'s glove after ""Force connection"" talk. That looked completely out of touch with how the Force works in the previous movies. The same problem is present in the scene with Yoda\'s Force ghost, when he summons real lightning from the sky and therefore directly influences events in the real world (and then he laughs about that like a lunatic).Why all armies in the galaxy don\'t use ""hyperspace torpedoes"" to ram spaceship fleets of the enemy, like Holdo did with the Resistance\'s spaceship, if that is so effective tactic?Also, why Resistance\'s ship commanders have to stay and die on their ships when all fuel is spent? We are shown that a ship without fuel is useless in any case, and so their death is also useless...Leia survives WITHOUT A SCAR massive explosions that killed everybody else on the ship\'s bridge, and she also survives vacuum of space (Jedi are not immortal, and without a space suit a Jedi / human would not survive for more than 60 seconds in space). Then she somehow moves herself through space back to the ship, while her dress is waving like the wind is blowing in space.Luke gives Han\'s golden cubes (dice) to Leia, knowing they have great emotional value to her, although he is aware that cubes will vanish in about 20 minutes because they are also ""Force projection"". That was a very cruel thing to do (and something that Luke wouldn\'t done)... A few minutes later Leia is leaving cubes behind when she escapes from the base, although our logic tells us that she would keep them. By the way, Leia and Kilo were able to hold dice in their hands. How? Han\'s golden cubes were ""Force projection"", and Luke showed us while he was ""fighting"" Kilo that Force projection is like a Force ghost - it could not be touched or held. BB-8 manages to disable guards by shooting a pile of golden coins at them. The BB-8 has special compartment for storing coins, and special device for shooting them? And so much coins were inserted in him in the casino? And coins are enough to disable the guards? Silly...BB-8 is piloting AT-ST walker alone, AND he is firing its cannons with great precision in the same time. 4 hands were needed for that in the ""Return of the Jedi""...Finn and Rose parked their spaceship on the beach of the casino planet, where it was easily seen and reported to the police, although they came there on a secret mission and should have landed on some hidden spot. That doesn\'t make sense...Finn and Rose enter the casino dressed in their usual clothes, although they don\'t want to draw attention to themselves. That was so naive and stupid... Would not be a better idea if they picked something to wear similar to those rich people around them? Rose is wearing dirty mechanic clothes when they enter the casino...Finn and Rose are releasing ""space horses"" from the stable, but not the children-slaves.Finn and Rose are trying to escape from the casino planet as soon as possible by riding ""space horses"", although they still didn\'t completed their mission (they didn\'t enlist help from a codebreaker). Why? As far as they know, the fate of the Resistance depends on finding the codebraker, but they just flee...On the planet Crait, Rose and Finn have relaxed, slow romantic scene and they share a kiss, while army of gigantic AT-ATs in front of them are firing on anything that moves, and First Order is just about to kill all their friends. Also, their ""love story"" was totally unnecessary and unconvincing.How is Finn (who is dragging Rose\'s body) able to cross the great distance back to the Rebel base after that, without being attacked? Kilo Ren is not suspicious when Luke holds the same lightsabre on the planet Crait as the one which was split in half shortly before that, when Kylo was confronting Rey.Rey falls into a body of water on Ahch-To and swims easily to the shore. She has spent her entire life on a desert planet. When did she learn to swim? Chewie, R2-D2 and C-3PO do almost nothing during the movie, they are there only because the movie should ""feel"" like a Star Wars movie to the older fans.Too much unnecessary jokes and humor, and too much Porgs - just to please kids who will buy Star Wars toys later...Poe\'s phone-prank at the beginning of the movie was cringe-worthy. That was the first sign for me that this movie may not be so great as I hoped it would be.Phasma was again completely wasted character, without any purpose in the plot (other than to boost sales of the action figure).\nRIPOFFS FROM THE ORIGINAL SAGA - 3 examples:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTaken from ""The Empire strikes back"": Surface battle on the remote white planet, complete with AT-AT walkers, low flying rebel fighters, secret rebel base hidden under the surface, trenches, rebel cannons, etc. (Battle oh Hoth)Taken from ""Return of the Jedi"": Kylo (Vader) brings Rey (Luke) to the Snoke (Emperor), while Rey (Luke) is hoping that Kylo (Vader) can be turned from the Dark Side. Snoke (Emperor) shows Rey (Luke) how the Rebel fleet is destroyed while they speak. Snoke (Emperor) has Rey\'s (Luke\'s) lightsabre beside him, which Rey (Luke) wants to get by using Force. Many parts of the dialogue are almost the same.Taken from ""Return of the Jedi"": Millennium Falcon is chased by TIE-Fighters through the mines of mineral planet Crait - that scene is almost exact copy of the chase through the Death Star in the Return of the Jedi, where we also had TIE-Fighters chasing Falcon through similar tight spaces and obstacles (they just painted them red in this movie).There are many more reasons why this movie is a failure... If you go to see ""The Last Jedi"", turn off your brain, banish all hopes, and just enjoy beautiful cinematography. At least they have done that right.', ""Terrible movie. So many fake reviews.Why couldn't we see just how much knowledge and power Luke and Snoke had. They had so much mystery and potential and it was wasted!!!Rey was a better pilot than Han. She's a better force user than Luke. She understands droids and Wookiees and can use force mind tricks... and she had no training. She made it into her 20's without doing things related to the force and now she can lift a mountain side?!If you think about it, Luke didnt do ANYTHING the entire time. I kept waiting for something that the other movies had. Something amazing that would bring you back to the theater again and again. This movie had a few scenes that were decent: Kylo and Rey vs the guards maybe... The slow speed chase and the Finn and Rose plot line was pointless! A waste of screen time. I could write so much more, but others have covered it. I want to give it half a star out of 100 but this will suffice. Oh, and a last thought: Walking out of the theater, I felt an emptiness. I had never felt that after any Star Wars movie. Is that what you were going for Mr. Johnson?"", 'The Last Jedi is obsessed with the fallacious idea that in order to move forward you have to destroy everything that came before. It is as if someone walked into the Louvre and said ""you guys need to stop holding onto the past,"" and then threw a torch down, cackling as hundreds of years of irreplaceable works of art burned to the ground, and then, standing triumphantly on the ashes, drew a smiley face.In order to make room for the new characters to shine, Rian Johnson obliterates the character of Luke Skywalker to the point that Hamill himself couldn\'t recognize him; in the Original Trilogy Luke Skywalker transforms from a whiny farm boy into a hero who proclaims ""I am a Jedi, like my father before me"" and manages to do what both Yoda and Obi-Wan thought impossible: bring Darth Vader back to the light. In this film, Luke is tempted to murder his own nephew before he even did anything wrong simply because there is a chance he may turn to the dark side, but the worst thing is that after that rather than attempt to fix his mistake he falls into a pit of despair and hides on an island as his friends are slowly wiped out by the First Order. When Rey arrives he refuses to train her or help the resistance in any way (despite having made a map to his location in the previous film), until a strange out of character pyromaniac Yoda force ghost appears and tells him Rey is perfect already and also the extremely cliched line that ""the greatest teacher, failure is."" Luke is not the only wasted character from the Original Trilogy either: Chewbacca serves as nothing more than comic relief and Leia is incapacitated for most of the film after a strange Mary Poppins-esque stroll through outer space. Admiral Ackbar is killed so unceremoniously you barely even notice he dies.The usage of the force in this film is wildly inconsistent with the previous films as well. First of all, force ghosts never were able to alter physical reality, yet in this film Yoda is able to bring lightning down from the sky, leading us to the question of why the force ghosts haven\'t just destroyed Snoke from their impenetrable positions in the netherworld. Leia is able to fly through outer space, and Snoke can force push people from across vast distances. Rey is able to lift multiple tons of boulders with apparent ease despite how difficult it was for Luke to make a single X-Wing in the Empire Strikes Back even budge. The force projection that Luke does at the end is actually interesting, but for some inexplicable reason they decide to make it kill him.From a critical standpoint, the film is an incoherent mess. There is little to no character development and the plot is little more than a long, drawn out series of ""gotcha"" moments; we are treated like dogs, as Rian Johnson dangles delicious treats above us before rapidly yanking them away. In the climax of The Force Awakens Rey finds Luke and extends his lightsaber, but in The Last Jedi Luke merely throws the lightsaber over his shoulder. Leia is sucked into outer space, only to magically force fly back to safety. Luke agrees to train Rey, but then quits after only one pathetic training session. Finn is about to heroically save what\'s left of the resistance, but - surprise! - he is saved at the last minute by his awkward love interest. Snoke is the most powerful sith in any Star Wars movie ever, but is anticlimactically killed by a cheap trick. The entire first half of the movie leads us to believe Kylo Ren and Rey will join forces, but after Kylo Ren saves Rey - surprise! - they\'re not going to work together: Kylo Ren will remain the stereotypical bad guy and Rey the infallible heroine. Rian Johnson had a chance to actually do something original and daring in this respect, but instead chose to take the safe route.The writing in this film is atrocious. Several lines are lifted verbatim from the Original Trilogy. The humor is out of place, overused, and sounds like they took the words of a heckler writing in the margins and thought they should actually put it in the movie (Star Wars meets Rocky Horror Picture Show). We are distracted by pointless subplots that are of no consequence. The new characters have no personality and sound like modern day buffoons who were simply transplanted into the Star Wars universe. There is so much wrong with it that you really just have to see it for yourself, although I would recommend not paying money for it. In conclusion, The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It is heretical. It is the anti-Star Wars. It stinks.', ""If they had congressional hearing into baseball doping...they need to investigate why reviews for this are so high.

I personally didn\'t watch any fan Theories and just went opening night to be entertained by another Star Wars movie. Instead Rian Johnson serves up a good lesson that quantity is not always quality.There were multiple new characters that had to share the screen that in essence the character development suffered greatly. Phasma was wasted again, Ackbar was killed off screen as an oh by the way moment, and Holdo was little more than a plot device to do the light speed suicide. It was never explained why she stayed on the cruiser, since the shuttle escape was a secret. (They didn\'t know yet they had been betrayed). In the second act when we keep shifting between the 4 concurrent plots I found myself thinking ""don\'t swipe back to Rose and FInn please"" because it was the least interesting plot line and it felt like Canto Blight only served to put some aliens into the movie to remind us we are watching a Star Wars movie.I enjoyed three moments in the film in total, and if I am being honest and the person next to me fell asleep in the middle and started snoring during the slow space chase scenes. The story failed to draw me in and entertain me the way The Force Awakens and Rogue One did. I just shook my head at the end, and felt meh about the entry. The plot and character development were just to hackneyed. think the theme of failure that was repeated to death, sums up what I felt about this entry in the franchise.', ""I just don't care about Star Wars anymore.

Lightsaber that has so much history that it causes Rey to have a force vision: we'll literally just throw that away and discard it.The irreverence with which they treated the world in this film really bothered me. The silly jokes at the beginning, Rose saving Fin, Rose kissing Fin, Rose's entire character. It all just made me feel nothing. When she kisses Fin I felt nothing other than a little anger that she was so incompetent and stopped Fin from saving everyone. I've been a fan for a long time, but I have no need to continue to watch them beat another franchise to death.

Starting off, I am somewhat a fan of Rian Johnsons past work. I recommend Brick to all of my friends and think it is a very well thought out modern Noir story. I even enjoyed Looper which I thought was an imaginative take on time travel. Though a major concern among people who have seen it and some critics is that it is filled with plot holes. Unfortunately it seems as though Mr. Johnson did not read these reviews... I am not a massive star wars fan. I never read the books, the comics or even watched the clone wars television series. I am not a die hard fan for Star Wars. But I am a die hard movie fan. I love movies for their storytelling qualities that let the audience experience something new and different. This major quality that I enjoy most in movies unfortunately is not found in The Last Jedi. Something that I will be referencing throughout this review is the term ""Deus Ex Machina"" which is a term used to describe a ""God Device"" or something found in a plot that arrives just as though a God put it there. I will use it very loosely to point out weak plot points that simply do not make any sense. Other reviews talk about how certain actors act and how some things don\'t feel right for Star Wars in general. I do not feel like I am knowledgeable enough to point out these flaws. So for all intensive purposes I would like to focus on the story just like I would for any other film. Now to the meat of my review! throughout the film certain things happen in the story that save characters from peril or fix problems they have. Comparing this to real life, we all have had occurrences where something Lucky happens to us and are saved from something horrible. But this does not happen over and over and over again. Starting from the beginning Leia is thrust out into space and is presumed dead. Nowhere in the past films has she been able to observably use the force and mostly can feel things through the force. How is it that right when she is flung to space she manages to not only be able to use the force but can do something that has never even been seen within the franchise? The entire focus in the first act is that the rebels main ship can barely stay out of range from the First Order. How come the First Order doesn\'t just speed up? Use just a smidge of light speed to cut ahead and become in range? this goes beyond the realm of possibility that they would just drag along behind them and not make the first move when they know they are weak. 3. The entire Finn story line is expendable. It could have never happened and the story could have still ended where it did. When writing I would think that you would look at the story and make sure every single ounce of the story was crucial to get from point A to Point B. Looking at the Finn story it is littered with Deus Ex Machina\'s for instance when they get arrested. They just so happen to meet someone in the cell who can break into the First Order? Later on, Finn fights Phasma then she happens to fall and die (waste of a character). Then Rose magically arrives with a small ship to get them off the burning ship. Later they crash onto the ""salt planet?"" and manage to be the only ship that gets into the hanger alive. WHAT ARE THE ODDS! I don\'t want to talk for hours so my last point with Finn is that before Hologram Luke gets barraged with laser canons, Rose passes out. So between Rose passing out and Hologram Luke gets blown to pieces Finn runs across this ""salt field"", Through laser explosions? and gets Rose back to the base in less than 5 miniutes. I\'m not even kidding look at the distance between the base, where he landed and the time when Hologram Luke gets attacked. Its ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever.There are other points I could bring up, like Finn getting rescued last minute by Rose. Snoke just so happened to get out of character and trust Kylo RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE SENSED HIS CONFLICT. Like yep... just said I didn\'t think you were a full Sith but now I trust you and I\'m going to close my eyes. Or the rebels luckily finding an escape root from their new ice fox friends. To conclude, the story is weak because so much happens through blind luck. This is what bad writing looks like everyone! Whenever someone sits down to write there has to be a cause and effect. There is none here. Just cause and luck. It just simply did not make any sense.This does not span to just Star Wars, but all of Disney\'s films. They lack good story elements that are either extremely predictable or just have random things save them right when they are in trouble. Do not be fooled by the great acting and flashy effects THIS IS BADLY WRITTEN. They say you support something with your money. So from now on I will not be paying to see a Disney owned and operated film for a long time. I am officially fed up with Star Wars, Marvel and dare I say Pixar. Please Disney stop destroying good storytelling and rehashing other peoples ideas!That is all.Thank You if you read all of this!!-TheFlood', ""No sense of danger, no tension, no interest and the jokes oh my god the wisecracks and the one-liners. What was that??\nThe actors are terrible, the new emperor was obviously a moron and his guards were beyond useless obviously too. When the fight breaks out around his throne not for one moment anyone believes the outcome is in doubt. It looked like a weak dance choreography.\nI guess I am tired of Disney's movie and that they release one a week. I never liked jokes and humour anyway."", 'It has been a while since I reviewed a film on IMDB. Most of the time, I just enjoy watching them, but this time I just had to say something. I can\'t guarantee that I\'ll avoid spoilers, so don\'t read below the asterisks this if you haven\'t seen the movie. In a nutshell, I\'m a lifelong Star Wars fanatic and I do not like this movie. In many ways, I rate this lower than the maligned Prequels. The film was released for purchase well over a month ago, but I will not be buying a copy. In my video library, there is not going to be an ""Episode 8"". There. I said it. I feel better now.Let the spoilers begin.\n***********I rate this film as 3/10. One star for John Williams\' soundtrack. One star because it\'s Carrie Fisher\'s very last movie. One star because Luke tells Leia toward the end of the movie: No one\'s ever really gone."" If it hadn\'t been for any of these, I\'d give it 0 stars. Well, actually IMDB requires votes of at least 1 so I\'d have to find some reason to give it one star.There\'s something different about this movie and about this series now that Kathleen Kennedy is in charge. She is just fine with allowing the directors total control over the plot and character development of every film. If that means that all continuity with the rest of the series is destroyed, then so be it. At least the ""creative freedom"" wouldn\'t be bridled. If you were a movie director, could you think of a better job than this? You have complete control to do whatever you want - no rules here. Rian Johnson knew that it wouldn\'t matter what he did in this movie - even if the fans rejected it, they\'d all see it dozens of times and the film would make well over a billion dollars world-wide.So he was free to:\n1) kill off beloved characters,\n2) destroy Rey\'s parentage,\n3) give BB8 special abilities he didn\'t have in the previous movie,\n4) introduce brand new paper-thin characters,\n5) destroy the entire Rebellion and the Jedi,\n6) re-define the Force,\n7) burn down the ancient Jedi tree, and \n8) add Yoda\'s stamp of approval on the entire mess.At one point in the movie, Kylo Ren says, ""I\'ll destroy you (Luke), and her (Rey), and all of it."" This is just what Rian Johnson set out to do. All of his decisions about what to do with this film point in only one direction: He wanted to bulldoze the franchise so he could start his own trilogy at some point in the future and re-do the entire series. I\'m going on record right here and right now. I\'m not seeing any more Star Wars films created, directed, produced, or even influenced by Rian Johnson for the rest of my life.', ""I waited until I watched at home again about six months after being disappointed in the theater hoping maybe I missed something. Maybe I was tired that night or something. Maybe my expectations were to high. Nope. The movie was just the worst Star Wars ever made. TFA was good not great but got ride of the bad aftertaste of the prequels. The movies were back on the right trace. Rogue One was incredible. Maybe the best Star Wars movies ever except Empire. Then this movie. There are thousands of reviews that will go into more depth than me but here's my main reasons why I think it's the worst. 1) Forced Humor and No Chemistry.Not since Padme and Anakin has there been little chemistry in a Star Wars film. The humor seemed forced. You really don't seem to care about anyone. Even beloved characters like Admiral Ackbar are killed in such a way you're like oh well.2). The CasinosNo need for this. Did nothing for the story. The CGI and production seemed straight out of the prequels. This whole sequence seems like something that would have been on the extras dvd of The Phantom Menace. 3). Plot HolesSo many to list. Just read other reviews on here. This director just didn't seem to care about all the movies and stories before this one. 4). Destroyed So Many CharactersSo many of our favorites and even new ones are served up for us horribly. Either being weak, dumb, or just killed this time. Luke and Leia. Finn. Ackbar. Snoke. Etc."", 'After watching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", all i can say is that the movie was a complete mess, poor direction, horrible editing, the fight sequences were good but utterly pointless. Luke sky walker\'s character has been decimated to the point of no return.This is hands down the worst movie in the star wars saga and in my opinion should not even be considered as a star wars movie. The movie was too long with an unnecessary sidetrack romance that added nothing in terms of story-line progression. The musical soundtrack was the worst in the series. After force awakens and rogue one, i was clearly excited to see the how the story would progress but alas i was let down with a movie that needs to called as Star Wars: The end"".']",/posters/xStar.jpg

This movie had a really good message and I believe even non Christians will like it."", 'I have gone to faith based movies before and always left for the most part unsatisfied. I can tell you this movie is different. You do not have to be Christian to understand and appreciate the story line. The movie is about forgiveness and hope and there is nothing wrong with that. The acting is well done, the story line is easy to follow and i must say there were more then a few times i got dust in my eyes and they watered. The song has touched millions and now the story will to. I heard it once said the song seems to never go away. Well there is a reason it never stops giving and the movie does not disappoint. I highly recommended this film.', ""I enjoy a wide range of movie genres. I don't seek out Christian movies in particular. I knew from the trailer the basic premise of this film, however nothing more. I knew it would be a tear jerker, but it has much more substance and is a good film on its own merits. Good performances, Denis Quaid did a very good job. It's sad that Hollywood would not even take this film seriously because, well I'll digress, someone would take offense or argue about my because opinions and I'm not a keyboard warrior. It's worth seeing in the theater, just take a Kleenex or 12."", '""I Can Only Imagine"" was a funny, interesting, inspiring, and powerful true-story about the most popular Christian song of all time. It was lighthearted and funny when I needed an emotional break, but the message was strong. If you don\'t go because it is faith-based, you are missing out. If you grew up in the Amy Grant/Michael W. Smith era like I did...it will be a little nostalgic. Watching the band struggle in the early years reminded me of every kid I knew as a camp counselor at Camp Electric in Nashville. It made me smile. Dennis Quaid was impactful as the abusive father. It had something for everyone. I\'ll be going back next week with friends.', ""This movie was a fantastic telling of Bart's life and the beginning of MercyMe.

You will be SO glad you watched this movie', 'Probably the best movie I have seen this year. I had heard Bart in an interview say this was his favorite song he has written (mine is ""Even If""). I have seen Dennis Quaid in several movies, but this was his best. Cloris Leachman was there. And Nathan must love to watch this movie to see himself tall. I don\'t know if he was bald back then or not. But the stand-out was J. Michael Finley. He looked a little like Bart and had his smile down perfect. From what I could see in the credits he did his own singing. Beautiful! Now for the story. What a heart-wrenched. No wonder Bart write such powerful songs. This is a must see movie folks. We saw it during a matinee at a mega theater (20 screens), yes, I\'m sure some of you have bigger, but that is big for us. The auditorium was almost full. I would estimate by the number of cars in the parking lot, that half of the people in the entire theater were in this movie. And the theater did not even have the title on the marquee. Shame! This is a must see movie.', ""My mom liked this movie but overall I was disappointed at how corny it was. The transitions between the scenes were awkward and although it was based on a true story the plot was rather cheesy (too much fluff). I haven't seen many Christian movies but if this is the better of the bunch then that's pretty sad."", 'I was completely bambokzled into seeing this movie. I was told it was all about music. I have never heard that ridiculously awful song and literally pray, I never have to again. Everything about this movie was ""B"" quality. The writing was comical, the acting was horrific and for a stupid song to have a movie made about it is a waste of money. Christians will love this drivel, of course but anyone outside of their blind obedience to god, stay away from this movie.', ""There was a time I sung this song in church before realising religion is crap. It's a pleasant enough tune but the film about its creation is awful. It's high reviews are based on a Christian bias I used to see all the time in my church days. Because it's Christian media it's eaten up by the church folk with no ability to make actual criticisms and make it even remotely interesting. This makes this film suffer from lazy unimaginative dialogue, camera and acting. Because like all Christian media it's creator doesn't have to put any effort into making something worthwhile in any capacity."", ""How bad is it?

I was interviewed by a local newspaper for an unrelated thing and was asked to provide my favorite movie and I said Pacific Rim. I have loved this movie since it was released in 2013, the best worst movie ever. \nUprising however could not have been more disappointing. I have watched the first movie upwards of 10 times and there is not enough money in the world to make me watch even a minute of Uprising. The unbelievably terrible dialog and lack of chemistry between all characters was soul crushing. What made the first movie great was the lack of plot and awesome fighting. This monstrosity took all the things that made the first one awesome and destroyed them over almost 2 hours. \nIt was an irreverent mockery of the serious and gritty tone of Pacific Rim. There were numerous points in the film where there was opportunity for a motivating speech or a selfless act of heroism but all of those were squandered with poorly written jokes or even more poorly written anticlimactic statements delivered with next to no emotion (see when Amara Namani says in the face of impending death ""at least we get to save the world"").\nThe end of Pacific Rim left us with a world in chaos and the Jaeger program disbanded. The beginning of Uprising puts the unfortunate viewer in a world where magically, AFTER THE WAR, the incredibly costly Jaeger program was reinstated and a CRAP ton of new Jaegers have been built, then almost immediately all but four were destroyed. I just wish I had been in the room when someone thought that this was a good idea.\nAmara Namani was portrayed admirably by Cailee Spaeny but some GENIUS decided to give her an almost identical backstory to the great Mako Mori.

From the start PR2 is off on the wrong foot, where PR2 had a powerful intro that set the stage for an action blockbuster, PR2 limps into a first act that I would have trouble remembering if I had written it myself. Gone are the heroics of Gypsy Danger nobly fighting on with just one pilot, here our hero is presented as a plucky 20 something with daddy issues and his sidekick is a whiny teen mechanic.Everything I loved about the first film is absent from its sequel, Guillermo Del Toros direction is clearly missed with almost no personality given to any of the Kaiju(a paltry 3 of them with no distinguishing characteristics) and Ramin Djawadis original theme remains yet is only played once, over an hour into the film, with no additional score at all!John Boyega shows just enough personality to stay awake while the rest of the cast simply turn up as well, Idris Elba knew he wasn't starring in Shakespeare in the original but at least he had the decency to ham it up a bit. The exception to this is Burn Gorman and Charlie Days portrayal of bickering scientists and friends, however even this is destroyed with the reveal that Charlie Days character is actually the villain being controlled by Kaiju?!?! It's weak. The third act does too little too late to redeem the film, with three personality-less Kaiju morphing into one really big personality-less Kaiju which the heroes have to effectively suicide bomb to overcome.

There was a plot twist that I didn't really see coming and I liked the idea and realisation of a batch of new, young Jaeger pilots better than I thought I would.Another good thing; The Yeagers are beautifully designed and pretty much all of the action happens in the daytime which is good.

When Lady Bird realized it and decided to grow up, she started naming herself Christine, the name given by parents----which could be considered as a come-back to home or parenting-----that's the time Lady Bird grows up. Being mature isn't mean that we are independent from parents or home, it's rather a childish act for proving oneself's ability to deal with everything by his/her own. Being truly grown up is, we started to cherish what we have, what we always neglected, being confident, brave, and still have beautiful belief in life. I wish every Lady Bird could be grown up into a better adult Bird, don't lose our pureness and faith, still we can fly to wherever we want, as far and long as we can."", ""As someone who went through the exact portion of their life that Lady Bird herself lived through not too long ago, this film pushed all the right buttons in order for me to leave the theater feeling very emotional and touched. I come from a relatively small, boring town in Pennsylvania and I ended up going to a university quite far from it. The college application process was just about as stressful as Lady Bird's, with just as much tension between my mother and I during it. And, of course, I went through normal soul-searching teenager feelings.\nThe thing that struck me the most of all the film was the very end, the coming to terms with herself and realizing all the tension with her mother was the result of realizing that her mom just wanted the best for her and for her to be happy in the end. There's a looming guilt that come with her voicemail to her mother, and that's honestly exactly what I felt the first week of being at my new university.\nIn terms of cinematography, the film never makes it hard to spot Lady Bird as she is very obviously made the dominant with her colored hair compared to everyone else in the film, as well as the fact the camera always seems to be entirely focused on her, because during the film there is a lot of non-verbal awareness of self that you begin to see on her face.\nThe film's colors are also very pastel and muted, with soft lighting that makes the film feel like a memory or a dream, which fits the mood of the film and having it take place in the very early 2000's. That within itself makes it feel all more like my own nostalgia as that period of my own life, while being very young, is very dear to me. However, the one thing in the film that wasn't quite as light and muted was the inside of the house that Lady Bird and her family resided in. The dark colors of the walls and the purposely claustrophobic feel of the house reflect the way that Lady Bird doesn't really FEEL at home where she is, and the darkness is almost like the tension that is present between her and her mother throughout the film.\nThe colors also become un-muted when Lady Bird finally goes to NYC and in the final shot of the scene. It leads itself to the somewhat grim but entirely real, no longer dream-like reality that Lady Bird is in: she's now living in a foreign place with no family or friends after having lived in the same place for her whole life with no one there to support her but herself. That very last shot is what I felt like I could relate too as well, the transition process in moving 300 miles away from home to Rochester, New York of all places (known for its bleak, cloudy days) and the guilt I mentioned earlier hits hard.\nI don't believe I'll be able to rewatch this movie any time soon, but I think that a few years down the line, maybe once I graduate and start working I will seek this film out and let these feelings wash over me again, and perhaps I'll feel them with less sadness but more nostalgia and will be able to self-reflect with them and realize how much I am capable of growing as a person. As a coming of age film, that's what it's all about, of course: letting people take a look back to see how similar or different their upbringings and life events were and how different you come out in the end."", 'Never thought that i would like it based on the trailer, but it is really good. This movie is about a young girl named Christine in her senior year and wants to go to college in new york after her graduation in a catholic school to prove to her mother that she is special. What i liked about it is that it has a realistic take on a simple and ordinary life of a girl in her teenage years, the character development from being a girl that wants a better life, does not appreciate what her parents had done for her, changes her name to Lady Bird because she didn\'t liked her name and impressing other students in her school in order to look cool, to a matured grown up that realizes that she has everything she needs with her family. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf are absolutely Oscar worthy in this movie,the love hate relationship between the both of their characters. Even though her mother was mad that Lady Bird lied to her about the wait list for her college, she cried when she decided not to send her off to New York. Apart from that, there are a lot of emotional arcs in it for example when Danny (Lady Bird""s ex) struggled to cope with his sexuality and did not know how to tell his parents. Also, surprisingly this movie has a lot of fun comedic moments which i did not expect. Overall : 8/10', ""I had the opportunity to watch this film during a day of seminars at my high school. We planned to watch this the first time we had the seminar, however not all of my classmates brought the permission slips. Now that everyone brought them, we truly kicked off the seminar with this film, and what be my thoughts?I really appreciated how realistic the acting turned out to be; the emotions, the situations and how the actors responded approach the struggles that plenty of high school seniors face in getting into college. The powerful implications behind the behavior of certain characters, especially Marion, bolstered this further by making the struggles even more believable. In some ways, it actually reminds me of my own problems when approaching college, specifically finding a school where I would fit well, do well, and be well but wouldn't financially strain my parents. The set designs aren't too special, again owing to the fact that they're attempting a realistic approach, but they are utilized nicely by the actors. I don't have much to say about the cinematography, since it covers the angles that would be used with one's eyes to view fascinating events, but doesn't do anything otherwise notable.Despite how much I enjoyed this movie, I feel like its messages and structure will appeal more to those who can immediately connect to it. I feel like the people who would most like this movie are ones like Christine, though I personally do not know many people who are in positions comparable to her own. I could recommend this to older families, but I do feel like a bit more caution should be taken with this film than with other films I rated 8. But should you consider seeing it anyway? Most absolutely."", 'I love Saoirse Ronan in this movie. She is hilarious,almost crazy. \nI loved how she portrayed her character ,Christine ""Ladybird"". She is different from everybody in the school,kinda like a nerd,except she is not a nerd. She portrays a girl that is not so popular in high school,and is a bit quirky.\n Her relationship with her mother is another story this movie tells. On the surface,she and her mother despise one another and can\'t agree to almost anything,but that is not true. They always fight because they are similar,and they have really strong independent personalities that just can\'t be contained. For me,their relationship was beautifully portrayed,with so many layers and so much depth. This movie is very heart warming and I enjoyed in it,probably because I am in my twenties and struggle with same problems as Ladybird. It\'s a very nice movie,fun and easy to watch. Totally recommend it.', 'How refreshing and invigorating to meet new people. Familiar and new all at the same time. Familiar because the extraordinary Saorise Ronan connected me to her soul, as soon as she appeared on the screen. Remarkable. She is, without question, one of the best actresses of her generation. She has exceptional support here, Laurie Metcalf as the mother determined to keep her feelings at bay, Lucas Hedges, providing one of the most moving, truthful moments in the film and allowing Saorise Ronan to give us a masterful class in empathy. Timothee Chalamet proves in a very short space of time that he is here to stay. His Elio in Call Me By your Name will be considered one of the great breakthrough performances in film history. Tracy Letts plays the father with irresistible humanity and then, of course, a heartfelt congratulations to the writer, director Greta Gerwing -', ""This excellent coming of age film has a perfect balance between humor and drama. Saiorse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, and Timothee Chalamet lead an ensemble cast that is breathtaking. The plot is not original, featuring a Catholic school girl rising above the stifling environment in which she is emerging as an adult. But, the dialogue is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Set in Director and Writer Greta Gerwig's hometown of Sacramento, California, the setting is like an extra character in the film. The camera captures friendship, first love, mother-daughter tension and the everyday lives of multiple people just living their lives. It is so simple in its goals but it hits a home run! Lady Bird deserves all of the hype that it has received.""]",/posters/xLady.jpg

The ""go-to"" scene in mostly every comedy, it includes a black light, a hotel room, and a whole lot of screaming. The humor in this film falls short, extremely short.

They land in Barcelona and go to the beach. They then go to a club where the lead ""meet cutes"" a DJ. There\'s not much chemistry but we are expected to think there is. They then go to a pretty lame house party where my favorite actor from Sense 8 has a fling with the one girl. There\'s a lame scene where she runs from a knife wielding lover and gathers her friends. There\'s possibly some comical moments scripted but it doesn\'t come together on screen. They then see that the hot DJ is playing in Ibiza. They mispronounce Ibiza. A lot. It gets annoying. They catch a flight and there is an awkward lengthy scene with guys at the back of the plane which ends in shots and party music. They catch a cab and are dropped off in the middle of nowhere to watch a sunset. This doesn\'t look like Ibiza at all. It\'s not. But hey, the actors are enjoying it. The audience, not so much. The club scenes are ok. The music is great. She finds her DJ. The end. At least, this is where I should have stopped watching. But I carried on, glued to the screen hoping for a glimpse of something amazing. There was a half decent scene where the fun friend attends the business meeting in Barcelona and steals the limelight for a while. Her performance was damn good. But then the lead takes over and kills the mood. I watched in horror as they returned home, she gets fired and makes her Hollywood exit. It ends horribly, soon after that. I felt betrayed by the plot. I wanted more. I wanted more laughter, more debauchery. More action. More sex. It felt like a documentary with a happy ending.', 'I loved this movie!

Now I just want to go out and travel and meet new people and dance my ass off. I dont get all the bad reviews on here so I had to leave a good one.

It\'s really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates ""heroic"" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney\'s great-great grandfather.I could forgive Wonder Woman\'s flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn\'t tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)And don\'t get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era\'s British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.Perhaps I\'m going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we\'ve all lowered our standards to rock bottom?', 'First of all, this movie only made money because it\'s a superhero movie. Everyone likes superheroes and there is no way a parent is not going to take their children to see it. Look at Transformers. Most of the movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money because it\'s.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will make money period. I can\'t make sense of the movie and I really don\'t think the writers knew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason to be ""bad"", the good guy has no real reason to ""die."" The side characters really didn\'t serve much of a purpose.Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the same scene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess and that act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the top of the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right there shows you that ratings are padded because you can\'t have at least 1/3 of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog and somehow end up at the top of the charts.', ""Zack Snyder strikes again. He wrote the script. It shows!No character development - this is an origin story. I wanted to see how Diana becomes Wonder woman, what experiences shape her on her journey, is she ever at conflict with her values? There is no single incident that actually affects or moulds her in anyway. Diana is essentially WW at the beginning of the movie. She does not grow into or earn this role. Nothing shapes or impacts her after she is WW either. She falls in love but would she have been a different WW otherwise? NO! In Iron Man, it took 2/3 of the movie, failures and multiple iterations, for Tony Stark to become Iron Man. His experience in the cave and learning that his weapons are used by terrorists, deeply impact and change him. Spider-man has to live with the guilt of his uncle's death, learn to use his powers, understand the balance of power and responsibility. Thor is born with all the power but it takes a whole movie for him to learn what it means to be a hero. Captain America has to become a leader and earn everyone's respect. Batman, Doctor Strange... there are so many examples of origin stories. The self discovery and growth are not implied, they are core and intrinsic to the story. WW does not have this core - she has an objective which is entirely different. For this reason alone, this movie is an epic fail in my book.Themyscira: I just hated this in its entirety Weird accent. Gal Gadot couldn't fake an American accent, so they had everyone else try to talk like her. Young Diana. The primary purpose is to elicit a 'cho chweet' response. She is a demi-god. There is no self discovery... why is she different, stronger than everyone else; how does that affect her? The 'train her, don't train her' non-issue. Diana gets combat trained despite her mother (and Queen!) not consenting. The arising conflict should have taken more than 2 lines of dialogue to be resolved. This would have also impacted Diana, her mother didn't want her to learn combat and suddenly wants her to be the best. Why? This is a page right out of Zack Snyder's Martha handbook of resolving issues.Fighting. The creative decision was that Amazonians don't fight, they ballet. Every jump, swing from a rope, shooting an arrow, getting off a horse is a dance move. It just looked ridiculous.Strike a pose: WW literally poses in each and every shot. She has her shoulders pushed back like she is trying to make her shoulder blades meet. It looks unnatural and odd. The poses are the exact same as in BvS. There is...wrists crossed in front of the face, crouching behind the shield, standing in a wide stance and the jumping pose with one knee bent. And they are shot exactly the same as in BvS. They probably just reused clips. They are not poses in the middle of a range of movements. It's pose, pause for 5 secs, next pose, pause for 5, repeat.Humour: This is not comic relief. They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and us. The bath scene, sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It's the same material stretched for 15 mins and frankly gets tiresome.Villain: In a weak attempt to create twist, the villain is introduced late in the film. There is no time to associate with the character. The villain exists simply as someone to be fought.Final battle: Visually, this sequence is identical to the doomsday fight in BvS. If someone mashes these 2 scenes up, it will be hard to differentiate one from the other.The McGuffin: There is no reason given why WW goes into hiding. What is the entire deal with the photograph and the secrecy? There's so much focus on this but it's not resolved.Gol Gadot: O!M!G! Could there possibly be a better WW? But she's posing and grunting though the entire movie. Very off putting. Her acting skills fluctuate quite a bit too. Perhaps since her character also fluctuates. WW goes from being head strong, doing what SHE wants, to naive and easily persuaded, to emotionally distraught by the horrors of war, to a super hero that's reckless. BTW since she has no clue of the real world, how does she know if she's fighting on the right side? Also considering Amazonians are warriors, for whom battle training is the only form of recreation, why is she horrified by war?Fight Choreography: Other than the training sequence, the choreography is a close second if not at par with the fights in Captain America 2 but the slow motion ruins it completely. It's not used to accentuate the fight, every punch goes in to slo-mo. If! everything! is! accentuated! nothing! stands! out! This coupled with the grunting just spoils each fight.Chris Pine: The best thing in the movie by a mile. His is the only character given some depth and Chris Pine did justice to the role.I understand the cultural, social and contemporary significance of this movie. But that is not reason enough for me to love it. I feel it completely failed to live up to the hype, even though reviews and box office prove contrary. But there may be a silver lining here. All the hype shows the love for WW and how long overdue the movie really is. I'm hoping they are going to make another one soon and I hope it's going to be far better. Isn't that what a superhero movie is about...hope?"", '~~~spoilers in tilde~~~The following is a (paraphrased) conversation between a supporting and main character in the middle of final battle scene. Mind you, there is absolutely no lead-up to the revelation that follows. ""We need to stop the bombing plane!"" ""Let\'s blow it up!"" ""We can\'t. It\'ll kill everyone if it\'s on the ground"" ""I\'ll fly it far away from everyone then!"" ""Okay but the bomb is on a timer""At this point, some words manifested themselves in my brain. Words like ""forced drama"" and ""asspull"". I turned my palm upright and apathetically stated, ""Seriously?"". My head turned to the moviegoers around me, expecting groans or eyes rolling, but saw naught but zombie-like blank stares. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they turned off their brains in attempt to salvage as much enjoyment as possible out of the $11.50 and two hours of their life they had lost. But alas coming here and seeing mostly rave reviews and ratings have proved my faith in humanity to be misplaced.---Wonder Woman 2017 is (or is supposed to be) a story of a naive but strong woman who discovers that humanity is not as black-and-white as a comic book is. She must journey to understand this trope and learn to use her strength to bring out the best in people. The movie begins with the titular character in her ""naive"" phase in a village isolated from a world in conflict. About 15 minutes into this and the movie has already betrayed its own narrative. To begin, there is no sense of ease. Not a single joke, not a playful moment, nothing. It\'s all character conflict, hints of future conflict, or expository world building (tell-don\'t-show instead of show- don\'t-tell). This is NOT how you convey naivety. The potential for character development is ruined within these first 15 minutes. In phase 2, the violence of the outside world stumbles upon paradise. Except it\'s not a paradise because we\'ve only ever seen people arguing with each other. What could have been an exciting ""awakening"" moment instead falls flat. Enter male MC. Almost immediately he steals the title with some innocent and light-hearted moments. The beginning looks even worse in comparison because now he\'s the naive one. What follows are poor attempts at chemistry between the innocent-but-not-really-innocent Wonder Woman (gadot) and the true star of the show (Pine). Skipping ahead a lot, a ragtag team of misfits is formed who generally don\'t get enough screen-time to develop or be explored. One is a guy who sees ghosts and this point is never mentioned again. In the middle is the only scene with any emotional weight where gadot charges an enemy trench ending years of stalemate. As expected of the horrible script however, the moment overstays its welcome. It moves right into an attack on a town without any pause to punctuate the significance of the scene. Skipping ahead again, there\'s more bad pacing and scenes without emotional impact. The ending is particularly terrible. ~~~The ""big bad"" who had been hyped throughout some scattered scenes is defeated effortlessly. As referenced in the beginning, Pine is the person who sacrifices himself in the end for the sake of a dumb plot-point. Naturally, you can\'t have a character better than the titular character surviving the franchise.~~~ A random supporting character is introduced as the true villain and some CGI magic occurs instead of some visceral man vs woman combat.Overall, almost everything was bad.The plot was terrible: twists or conflicts happen with little-to-no buildup.The directing was terrible: scenes are poorly timed and paced.Gadot is terrible. Of the few negative reviews here, most criticize her horrible uninspired performance, which is true, but then again how could anyone perform such a bad character? Pine is actually interesting ~~~but is killed unremarkably because he is too interesting. I wonder if the writers realized this. Why didn\'t they fix it if they did? ~~~.The action was bad: while I don\'t really mind obvious CG anymore, there was a complete absence of visceral ""human"" fights that DC have had in the past, like when Bane is savagely brutalizing Batman with his fists and there\'s no orchestral accompaniment or CGI to be found. Maybe it would have looked weird with a lanky gadot beating down or getting beat by a villain. Then again you could have just got rid of her and gotten a better woman. In fact just get rid of everyone except Pine while you\'re at it.Final rating: 3/10*Note: I felt compelled to rate as a 1/10 to offset the fake reviews (by shills perhaps? Or maybe Idiocracy is becoming a documentary).', ""I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact that this film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight, The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. The critics took the money on this one and ran. To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. The ridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there's clearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue), yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!! AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is a British Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accents and she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions.... I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As an origin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when the comic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attempt to pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politically correct. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoid a visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and make your own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20 years."", ""For as long as I could remember this website was a beacon of light guiding me throughout a vast ocean of bad movies, actors and directors.

Gal Gadot is beautiful, sexy and physically looks like Diana Prince, but she's not an actress. Well, at least not for a character with this depth. I actually felt sorry for Chris Pine, which is the only salvageable thing in this 2h20min disaster. The movie has zero continuity, it's so bad written it makes you wonder how these guys ever got into a position to have had the chance to write something like this. It seems as an 11 year old could have written it on the car ride before school.I don't want even get started on the details, because everything major on this was wrong. From now on, I'm not sure how I'll trust IMDb again."", ""I guess all the really bad Germans have been exhaustively & now boringly used up one to many times,beat dragged & tortured in the previous thousand turkey shoot WW2 movies from the Longest Day to Inglourious Basterds ... maybe having an Israeli IDF glamour girl pummel the last surviving movie Nazis seems rather unsportsmanlike.So now we have fresh meat Germans from WW1 that just aren't as Kosher as the WW2 bad-ass Nazi robotrons . It just doesn't come across as the good fight,IDF Wonder Woman against the exhausted muddy trench fighting & dying Germans of the Kaiser's Army. Wonder Woman defending the huge British Imperialist Empire against the upstart smaller German Imperialist Empire. What Empire should I root for?So duel citizenship Wonder Woman kicks Kaiser Sheev Palpatine Admirals right of the bridge off the first Allegiance-class Star Destroyer she crosses paths with...ops, wrong universe ... kicking Kaisers Wilhelm's poison gas snorting quasi-Nazis off the bridge of the nearest Zeppelin so the smaller Axis of Evil Ottoman Empire can be carved up & the righteous State of Israel formed on the back of the defeated Turkish subjects thanks to Wonder Woman!Well...basically that is the historical time-line.Hollywood writers wet dream rewrite of history since they now have picked clean the dried carcass of WW2 & can finally move on,but the sidekick American Hero going futuristic suicidal jihadi just doesn't bode well for gentlemanly slaughter of 1914. Lawrence of Arabia versus Wonder Woman might be in the works with smart-ass Shia LaBeouf as Captain Lawrence.Maybe I'm reading to much in this generic CGI feast on the eyes.but I have to as this endless stream of Marvel/DC comic green screen movies are blurring into each other .Now the original corny T.V Carter always seemed like an awkward top heavy super hero gal but Gal Gadot comes across as a sweaty Stairmaster extra & just as talented as a 10lb Dumbbell."", 'I don\'t get it. I must be completely out of touch with what is popular for today\'s movie going public, and am scratching my head how this terrible movie receives such good reviews. This was the first movie I\'ve been to at the cinema that I wanted to leave. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. I decided to stay to see if things would turn around. Big mistake. I fought back the urge to get out of my seat a further two times staying till the end. One of the only things keeping me going was getting home to go online and enjoy the critics laying into this atrocious movie. Only they didn\'t. They loved it. Apparently this is one of the best superhero movies of the year (""slash,"") ever. If so I\'m glad I\'ve avoided most of the others. The plot and dialogue was extremely dull, and the WW11 setting didn\'t really take the film anywhere beyond the realms of mundane. People seem to be getting giddy about how the film represents a positive step for feminism. This again shocks me as the film seems to be quite anti-feminist in it\'s nature. Just because the films main character is a woman doesn\'t mean this film is feminist. I swear that most if not all the people who have rated this film highly have either been brainwashed, or they are idiots, I can think of no other explanation.Back to the content, and after sitting through rather lousy dialogue, we get to the part in the film where, Diana is introduced to a trio of guys who are going to help her out in her mission. And what a trio they are, they get my vote for the worst characters in any film ever and instantly took this film from a 1 out of 10 to a -2. I\'m not going to name them. They are not worth it. If they weren\'t bad enough the villains are also exceptionally bad, a grumpy Nazi general, and a woman with a disfigured face, covered phantom of the opera style, with the moniker Dr Poison. In another film this might be a fun nickname, unfortunately the grayness of the Nazi\'s and the backdrops we find them in just make Dr Poison seem dull. There are a couple of fun moments in this film, like a trailers worth, and to be fair they are no means exceptional. Just plain standard. As such this is a film that has not pushed a single boundary. Spoiler (this next part reveals what happens at the end of the movie.)The worst part for me was the climatic battle at the end. It would take some extremely effective and persuasive acting for a British male mustachioed MP type to play Ares (based on the Greek God with the same name,) here we reach the films climatic failure. The fight now just seems stupid. For what, omg, that politician guy I never cared about is Ares! Facepalm. Most pointless twist ever.Superhero films seem to be popular and make a lot of money at the Box office. Hopefully one day people will wake up and stop eating this garbage, and If you think this film represents a step in the right direction for feminism you probably need your head examined.', 'OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***The first half of the movie was sooooo slow I had to literally hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep so im not gonna talk about it. Now correct me if im wrong but this was billed as a ""summer action movie"" correct? Well when its 2:10 mins and only about 15-20 mins is actual action I have a problem with that. Don\'t get me wrong when she was all kickin ass and whatnot it was awesome and I dug that part a lot, thats why its saddening to me there was so little. Also on the plus side the chemistry with her and Steve was good ... so of course he dies lol. (sidenote he would have made a good Green Lantern with the chemistry they showed) On the down side, once again a very slow movie till the bunker scene (which was bad ass) and then nothing again till the final fight which again there was no real Villain presence till the last 10 mins and even then she spent half of that time fighting mustache man Ares and not God of war Ares and as we all know for me the villain makes the movie. I give it a 3/10 its not bad like Ghost Rider/Fantastic Four bad its just not what I expected or hoped for at all.', ""Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie. Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie was only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles. However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings. Don't waste your time and money with this movie."", 'I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was......... BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not great and accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting - I think I caught ""Blue Steel"" face a few times. Gal is gorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they not have found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was more Wonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about being beautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explain snow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn\'t like looking drop dead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just another Hollywood ""preach it"" to the public movie only this time the super hero is thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, and condescending.', 'So I decided to go and see the movie because 8.1 is such a good rate in IMDb. And seriously, what could be better than a hot girl with superpowers killing Nazis. However when I was seeing it I felt that it just was another superhero\'s movie with nothing to offer more than the same poor structure of the majority of bad superhero\'s movies: a half naive hero finding her path to kill an evil character that is the responsible of all the bad stuff happening in the world. In the mean time, the hero decides to believe in clichÃ©s like ""find love"" and ""everything is about what you believe"" and while she win the knowledge of those clichÃ©s, by very poor reasoning by the way, she increases her power to kill the evil character. So it was an extremely predictable movie that we all have seen 80 times but with a hot girl in it. Besides, the rules of the game were never clear, for example: at the end of the movie she decides to forgive the life of a German person because it was the right thing to do and she was so just and good, but during all the movie she was killing people, so one never understands where were the line between the good and the bad, the only thing that helps you to understand the line between the good and the evil was that in one side you had giggling English men and in the other side you had enraged Nazis. And on top of that, the characterization of Ares during the movie is just painful, they put it like a demon that believes that humanity is substantially bad and that they should kill each other for that, but Ares is the god of war and it also means understanding honor, courage and the beauty of the fight, which is very far from the Nazi\'s horrors. If Ares didn\'t exist, the Wonder Woman couldn\'t exist either because she is a character built on the vigor of war. I give it a few stars because the build up of the beginning was actually cool and kind of funny.', 'Saw Wonder Woman yesterday... quite frankly it\'s actually really bad. Story line all over shop, character development, all over the shop, main Charakter Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 16 year old imbecile, she\'s a goddess for crying out loud, the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up and all over the shop. The way she kills Ares in the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was from the get go and a full 2hrs earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. I\'m not even getting into the feminism part of it. In Greek mythology Amazons were mainly concerned with war and were rather brutal. To be expected if they were the supposed children of Harmonia and Ares. Yet in the movie they are portrait as peace loving, just, fair, superior beings to all mankind. But also especially superior to men who are essential for procreation and useless otherwise, really?!It wouldn\'t have hurt if ""Wonder Woman"" would have hit the gym before filming commenced. But I guess if your main character believes that love is the ultimate answer to all of mankind problems, there\'s no need for that either. The rainbows one can vomit, lightning actually in this case, with all that fuzzy love feeling are blinding your opponents into oblivion, which she kinda did... there you go... The women training her in the movie looked fitter and in better shape than Gal Gadot despite being twice her age, at least in the movie. All this seemed like a bad parody of Thor and captain America, without the humour, without a plot, and atrociously bad acting from an otherwise good cast. So all this really is, a quick money maker with main selling point: ""Female Lead"" I am all for women kicking ass, in movies as a well as real life, here however, to me, it\'s all to artificial and contrived. For example, in iron man one can believe the change Stark is going through, for one, out of necessity,shrapnel in his chest, for the other he decided to use his wealth for the good because he actually sees what his weapons are causing. Captain America, he\'s full of idealistic ""Americaness"" alright but is cool, most important the character does not come across as naive. WW did not need to be so clueless. As far as the plot goes she\'s naive because she was sheltered from the world, fine, but yet she had access to literature about how Humans procreate but not about how the world outside her realm operates? And the character seemed to struggle almost seems to resist to accept the reality she finds herself in. Whereas good old captain America, after 70 years of sleep, just keeps kicking ass. Her character development seems awkwardly written. To me, the biggest disservice to the movie. Overall the movie also felt sadly discombobulated. And then there is the WWI one setting... no one is expecting historic accuracy here, however, to try to glorify or find good in something that was so absolute and inherently not good. More specific to bring in the gas, as was used in WWI on a massive scale for the first time in modern warfare on top WWI having been a downright horror show in recent human history, dunno mate, it\'s bound to fail in a movie like that.Marvel also incorporated WWII in Capo America, but didn\'t even try to bring in the concentration camps for example, it would have opened a can of worms the audience wouldn\'t have bought and it\'s not what captain America was about. Also the narrative flow is way better with Marvel I find.', 'First of all, I\'m a woman and I\'m pro gender equality and both men\'s and women\'s rights.. and no this is not about armpit hair or female power. I don\'t think art owes anyone anything. Here\'s why this movie sucks on its own merits: 1- Out of all the Amazonians in the movie, Gal Gadot looks the weakest and least fight- ready. She could\'ve hit the gym as in her current physique compared to women twice her age in the movie she looks like the one who had to sleep with the coach to make the team. Her having the only Hamstrings that swing like jelly amid a fight scene full of women in their fifties makes you wonder. 2- Choosing the First World War as a background was a horrible idea! I felt I was watching a war movie gone bad. Depressing, ugly, frustrating and sad to watch to the point of distraction. What happened in WWI was too tragic even for a superhero to fix. Terrible juxtaposition insulting the sensibility of any person who read anything of value about that war. 3- The introduction of how brave a child she was, was way too lengthy and culminating into some of the most stupid scenes I\'ve ever watched. All that hogwash about not telling Wonderwoman who she ""really"" was ends up getting on your nerves. 4- She sees a mortal from earth for the very first time and all the movie has to allude to in their early conversations is his (according to him) ""above average"" penis??? Come on! 5- She was annoyingly naive! More like wonder sissy not wonder WOMAN. Hissy fits ooh take me to your leader! 6- The God of war, the super evil devil like character she has to fight is an elderly guy completely out of shape and appears to be more like the God of Arthritis. I thought Gods don\'t age judging by the fact that she doesn\'t! Only male Gods do? Now that\'s sexist. 7- I would like to register here my great disdain (eff you Hollywood) for making the villain in the movie someone with a scarred face. So pretty people can\'t be villains? In fact all the villains are either old, fat or scarred. 8- My second eff you Hollywood moment came when the spy object of wonder ""woman""\'s (she was a virgin in the movie so please take note) affection decides to save the world by flying away in a plane loaded with all the lethal gas grenades but lo and behold instead of a million sane solutions he decides to commit suicide for the cause making the plane explode in the air with him in it. I thought this is pretty much the same Jihadi principle of heroic suicide!! Bad, bad, bad! Not to mention that such gas would kill people anyway in that nearby village they were banging on about the entire time. I\'m not even gonna go over the scientific bullshit this movie is full of and historical inaccuracies, or plain stupidity because boy oh boy that will take all night .. but just one thing because it\'s really REALLY getting on my nerves... how does a woman stuff a long sword down the back of revealing dress having the blade go all the way down her ass (if that\'s even possible at all), then a villain wraps his arm around her back to dance without feeling it? Have the idiots who wrote this scene ever held or seen a real sword? Do they know real swords aren\'t bendy? Wtf? 9- I\'m not sure why there was a Red Indian guy in the British barracks helping an English spy. Why Red Indian? Bring in the Chinese community because the actor looks Chinese? Method in the madness or just madness? 10- The fight scenes are lame and boring. Really boring! In one instance they had to speed the frame to make Gadot look like she\'s doing something and they didn\'t even bother mask the fact the scene was sped up digitally. 11- If Wonder ""woman"" kills the god of war making all the German soldiers have an awakening kissing and hugging each other in great relief they just lost (criiiiinnnggggeee moment), how come WWII started only 19 years later? Did they think we will just forget about that one because it\'s only a movie? Why not choose the background to be WWII so it\'ll make more sense (if that\'s even possible for this movie?) ... 12- I felt I was watching an American wrestling WWF show gone really bad... at one point, the men actually give Wonder ""woman"" a simple leg up for her to fly high in the air to destroy a tower with her bare fist. Which reminds me, my husband needs me to help give his nuclear rocket a piggyback ride into outer space, so I\'ll talk to you later.', ""seriously!? this movie deserves nothing more than 5 out of 10 stars. Terrible film. Acting was horrible. Story made little to no sense at all. Action was mediocre at best.. people need to realize that being politically correct doesn't require you to give this film a good rating. 1) the amount of cuts used was unbearable. When a director uses a lot of cuts, its usually because the scenes are action packed with timeless stunts. The stunts shown should not have required so many cuts. 2) the story was extremely rushed and left with plenty of plot holes. There was no introduction to her powers. just oh Zeus made you perfect. We do not know exactly what powers you have just that you're a god killer. Wonder Woman knows nothing about the political side of the war but automatically assumes with no good reason provided to her that the Germans are the bad guys.... what!? how is it we see her growing up as a child, then all of sudden stop aging. for a 100 years.... (WW1 ended 1918... she was using a tablet. 2017 technology)3) due to what i believe was a terrible script, the acting was horrendous."", 'So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. Let us start with the bad. The CGI is horribly bad. It is so obvious and so badly done I keep wondering if this movie was made in the early 1990\'s. I saw this movie the day after seeing Agents of Shield season finale, and AoS had 10-times better CGI. Did they not get money to do a WW movie? The story moves way, way too fast, throughout the movie. They jump from this to this and there is no time to breath, catch up with characters or develop any sense of location. It feels like this movie should have been 2 hours longer and I can only assume it was cut down to fit the American public that love fast pace action set pieces. Diana is a kid, swhoosh, Diana is training, swoosh, Germans are evil and let this Jewish woman go kill them for some reason. Then they jump on a boat and faster than The Flash they are in London, and then swoosh they are in the war, then dancing and then off fighting and whopidoda the movie is over. I got the feeling I was fast forwarding 10-15min all the time. Did they cut out 2 hours? Was the script this bad? The villains were pretty boring and badly flushed out. People keep complaining about Marvel villains, but this was far worse and in a fast pace movie like this you really do need to feel the strength and power and immense danger of the villain(s), but in this movie you do not. Not at all.I also need to mention that I hate that the ""hero"" is fighting the poor Germans in WW1, of course the central powers and Germans were the good guys in WW1 (as far as such things goes in a world war\x85), but the propaganda must go on\x85The good? Well, Gal Gadot is good as WW, most of the supporting characters are good as well. Most of the action, if you can ignore the bad CGI, is good. The general story, if ignoring all the plot holes, is compelling and there are a lot of fun and great moments in this movie. There is a good/great movie here somewhere, but it is cut away and hidden under badness. If you can relax and just enjoy the ride and not let the bad elements mention above take you too much out of the movie this is okayish. I give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is entertaining after all, but not as good as Man of Steel which is still (to me) the best of the DC movies and also, strangely enough, the DC movie with least Christ-imagery\x85 Are all DC characters supposed to be God? Or Gods? Is that the point? Boring. Edit: Just saw the movie again last night and having time to focus on the movie and how good/bad it is, I detected a lot of other issues, inconsistencies and weirdo plot holes I missed the first time around. Consequently I will lower my score to a 3 out of 10.', ""I disagree with the hype. Spoilers WARNING...The script was pedestrian; the pace was scattered (too fast in the beginning, and too slow when putting the team together); the logic was heavily flawed (one night on a small sailboat in the middle of the ocean with no indication of where they were and you're in London the next morning? One person/Diana single- handedly suppresses a whole front line of gunfire with her shield and wrist-cuffs? A German sniper repeatedly missing multiple non-moving and completely exposed targets? Steve's team of mostly non-soldiers barging through a German camp without much resistance? A spy able to just blow up a whole camp by himself in broad daylight on the fly without being discrete?); wasted/under-explored story lines (Dr. Poison under-explored; Steve's friend, who's supposedly a deadly sniper, unable to shoot, huh?); the motivations/rationale for some of the characters' decisions were a stretch, if not unconvincing (Wonder Woman's mom initially not permitting WW to be trained in combat, especially when we found later in the movie that WW is the God Killer? Steve insisting on going after the German general while armistice was being negotiated? Team just decides to continue fighting without further pay after initially clamoring for money while nothing happens in the process that shows they're moved by something other than money?); unexplained parts that the audience is simply expected to accept (power of the wrist cuffs was never explained; Dr. Poison loses her notebook, but all of a sudden, just conveniently finds a scrap of paper that turned on the light bulb for her; Steve's conversation with Dr. Poison at the gala about seeing her experiment didn't make much sense at all). There are more other issues with this film, but there are more than enough listed above already. All in all, I saw way too many flaws in this film to agree with any of the hype."", 'How is it that these days a movie like this can be made? I\'ll tell you why. It\'s simply another money grab!The main actor runs around casually lifting her arms up now and then to deflect bullets. First of all, she never even trained for that! She practiced sword-fighting and athletics, and suddenly she can follow bullets using eyesight and deflect them? She\'s also acting like her mind is miles away. ""Do I even look good while doing this?"" ""What would my friends and family say when they see me in this suit?"" ""Omg, I\'m going to be so famous!"" Girl, get your head straight. You\'re ruining your performance by not being in it!The fighting scenes are very poorly choreographed, it\'s almost as bad as Jessica Jones.Story line is full with holes and one big clichÃ©. Girl discovers her powers, finds a handsome guy, falls in love and follows him while pretending to go out and save the world because it fits the story. Handsome guy dies, fueling her rage so she can kill the bad guy. It\'s almost like this travesty of a movie rolled out of a factory. There\'s even a sex scene to top it of, even though Wonder Woman tells the handsome guy that they don\'t need men to pleasure themselves. Feminists must have loved that scene...The handsome guy is way to under-explained, so are his buddies. I never cared for them at all. But whatever right? After all, I should be looking at WW. But the sad fact is, I don\'t care for her either! We see a few scenes with her as a little girl, and a few scenes with her as an adult before she goes out and steals the so called ""God Killer"" to run of with her new boyfriend.Now, I don\'t know anything about WW, but this ""God Killer"" is supposedly an ancient magical sword to be used against Ares, the bad god. This actually made sense if it wasn\'t for the fact that it\'s a dud, and the true ""God Killer"" is WW herself. Surprise! And her mother obviously knows this, so she doesn\'t even care to make sure WW actually has the sword before she almost callously waves her only daughter farewell forever. In turn, WW herself doesn\'t care for her mother enough to reassure her she has the sword which would give her at least a fighting chance against Ares. This complete disregard of the sword, and emotionless farewell ruined the whole movie for me. Everything else simply added to my frustration.She apparently knows all about the outside world, speaks like 2 dozen languages, knows all about sex without ever having had a real man in her life, but then acts like a little lost girl when she arrives in London. Apparently they forgot to educate her on ""modern"" society and how to conceal a sword and shield. And while we\'re at it, they also forgot to educate her about the world war that\'s been ravaging humankind. I mean, what the hell is that?! How do you protect humankind without knowing what\'s going on? Without ever having the chance to return home once you leave for battle? This is too stupid to even discuss.Whatever...', ""This movie was average, at best. Really poor acting on Gal Gadots part. The story was very predictable, CGI was poor, and the story was phoned in. I really couldn't care less about any of the characters, and there actions were incredible illogical. I had hope with a twist at the end that it would get better, but once again, it just fell flat."", ""My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of action but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that good of a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't like it."", ""I am careful these days. I don't generally trust overwhelmingly good reviews and let myself be lured into the cinema by high ratings, but somehow I fell for the high score for Wonder Woman here on IMDb.Maybe I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Maybe I thought this could be the exception to the rule. At least, I didn't expect to be utterly disappointed and bored. Where to begin? - - SPOILERS AHEAD - - - The only thing I liked about this movie was the early action sequence on the beach. I thought the clash between the Amazonians and the WW1 soldiers was well made.Here are the things I didn't like:All the clicheÃ©s - 1. Not telling Diana who her father is 2. the 'train in secret' clichÃ©e 3. the 'average' joke 4. the dressing montage 5. the evil German killing his own men/how cartoonishly evil he wasthe scarred, evil scientist that looks for a formula. 6. the unnecessary heightening of the evil guy's strength 7. the 'oh, Wonder Woman is so stunning' by every man in the movie 8. the late predictable reveal of who Ares is etc.The whole time I was watching, I couldn't help thinking that this movie should have been called 'Steve Trevor' instead. He is the only one with a little character development, motivation and plot. I hated that Wonder Woman was basically just following him around, deciding in the worst moment to do something foolish and run into a hail of bullets just to later lose what she fought for in that instance, then lose faith in an anticlimactic moment, after seemingly having reached her goal.For a movie that wants to be progressive, it spent an awful amount of time commenting on how Diana was never dressed for the occasion. First in London, then at the gala in Germany. And you know what? I felt bored. Really, really bored. No gripping story, main character or action.The CGI was silly (lasso, bad guy's face, WW in some shots). The deflecting of the bullets was silly. The destruction of the tower and other brickwork was silly. The sword in the dress was silly. The resolution of the movie was silly. If this review helps to stop only one person from spending money on expensive cinema tickets and popcorn, raises doubt in the mind of only one young writer about the quality of Hollywood scripts, makes only one person wonder if we have really come this far from 1950 sexist comic Wonder Woman becoming the Justice Leauge's honorary member and secretary, then I can call myself lucky."", ""I'm not going to get into the generalities of why this movie was terrible, I'm going to be very specific about scenes that left a bad taste.1. Wonder Woman's aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn't get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she's a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt's sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. 2. WW's mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don't do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don't train my daughter to fight, don't let this guy leave the island, don't go with the guy leaving the island. 3. WW essentially causes every innocent death in the movie. She leads a battalion through 'no mans land' and liberates a town. Then everyone in the town is killed by a gas attack that only targeted the town because it was liberated.4. WW is incredibly impulsive and stupidly clings to mythology rather than listen to many people try to reason with her. Chris Pine repeatedly tells her to wait for him and she does the opposite. Wait outside this door, she goes in. I'm going to sneak into this castle in disguise, she shows up in an evening gown and blows up his plan. He tells her killing one guy won't stop the London gas attack. She runs off and kills that guy only to freak out on Pine because she was wrong. 5. Chris Pine's character commits suicide for no reason. He steals the airplane with the poison gas (which is conveniently flammable gas) and shoots it while he's flying mid-air; sacrificing himself to dispose of the gas. If he only thought to look for a parachute he could have left a grenade in the plane and jumped out. OR he could have asked WW for one second of help; instead he tells her he loves her.All and all the movie is a cluster F and signals the entire DC Universe is going down in flames under this leadership."", 'Whether or not you\'ll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it\'s setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn\'t read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!The story is pretty different from my concept for ""Wonder Woman"". This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn\'t much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won\'t bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist\'s mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse.', 'I really do not understand how this movie is being hailed as the ""best superhero movie of the year"" or the DCEU comeback to Marvel. This movie\'s script is terrible, especially the ending, which makes absolutely no sense (I will explain in the spoilers portion below.) It also doesn\'t really do anything to develop the characters. When they do take a minute to say something about someone or add a little character into themselves, POOF! They\'re gone, not likely to return. I can\'t really blame the actors and actresses here for anything because they try to work with what they got. Unfortunately, the script does nothing to help them along. That makes the dialog bland and clichÃ© and drags the movie down even more.Regarding the technical effects, they were OK. The CGI in the fight scenes had some really awkward looking shots, which made them look really manufactured. This is especially true in some of the sliding attacks. I almost wish that they utilized wire-fu/Hong Kong effects a little more in these types of movies as it looks more graceful and less ""weird"".Overall, I say skip this one. There are better superhero movies out there and coming soon. Spending your money on this will just make you wish you had your money back afterwards.--Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS-- --Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS--OK, let\'s get to why the ending sucks so bad. If you understand how anything works, you will instantly disbelieve the decision of Steve Trevor to blow himself up in the plane. It makes absolutely no sense other than to anger Wonder Woman, which was already done with the shell hitting Veld and the flashback Ares shows her. Also, there are many ways that Steve could have resolved the situation without killing himself. First, he is in Belgium, so when the plane takes off, he could simply fly out into the water, drop the bombs into the ocean, then land the plane, either back in Belgium or in England. Second, they could shoot out the tires or the engines on the plane, making it impossible to fly. Third, he could simply radio the Allies from the plane, or tell the other guys to call (they did this earlier) and land in France. Any of these would have worked as he had control of the plane.The second issue I had is the gas itself. They spout on about how blowing up the plane will effectively make a 50 sq mi. gas cloud, but not a minute or two later, the factory and everything around it is being destroyed. I\'m sure there were still a few bombs left in there, yet everyone seemed just fine afterwards. Also, why in the world were guards walking around with gas masks when the gas was inside the bombs already? They drilled it into our heads about how the gas masks wouldn\'t work against it, yet the guards still decided to put them on? It\'s just dumb. Add in the fact that mustard gas is a blister agent, with no one in the town showing blisters, as well as the fact that they magically produce tons of this stuff in less than 24 hours for the big bomber and it is stupidly laughable.What gets me the most about these logic issues are that it\'s the non-superhero stuff that they messed up on. You had two people (gods) flying and fighting in the air during the climax of this movie and, truth be told, that was more acceptable and believable to the story than a pilot getting into a bomber and blowing himself up. Honestly, skip this one.']",/posters/xWonder.jpg
Ocean's ElevenÂ (2001) ,(2001),7.8,1h 56min,"['Crime', 'Thriller']",PG-13,Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously.,Steven Soderbergh,George Clayton Johnson,"['George Clooney,', 'Brad Pitt,', 'Julia Roberts']","[""Freshly released from jail Danny Ocean begins to recruit key players to put together a job as daring as it is dangerous - the safe that holds the money for 3 casinos belonging to Terry Benedict.  As well as splitting the $150 million between the gang, Danny also plans to steal back his ex-wife Tess who is currently dating Benedict.The first movie wasn't exactly brilliant - only really interesting because it brought the whole rat pack together onscreen for the first time.  This could have easily fallen into the same trap - trading purely on the stars' names rather than an intrinsic entertainment value.  However it manages to take what worked from the original and give it a great modern shine.  The story is daft of course, but it moves forward with a sort of slick illogical cleverness that appears wonderfully clever but is, of course, highly unlikely!  The story unfolds in an entertaining manner, the build up is great with no dull moments as we meet the characters and find out the details of the job bit by bit.The job itself is well handled.  It is so slick that you don't mind that it couldn't possibly work in real life, but instead it just appears so clever! The romantic subplot I found to be a little redundant and I didn't think that Clooney and Roberts had good chemistry - compared to Clooney and Lopez in another great Sodenberg film `Out of Sight' where the screen crackled! However it takes up little screen time and compliments the heist quite well. Sodenberg handles the film well and doesn't allow his direction to be slick without substance - the editing is clever and Las Vegas internally and externally looks great.Clooney is fantastic in the lead - his strength is that he has great charisma which means he doesn't have to ham it up.  Instead he does his stuff but allows others to try and shine while he is comfortable with a constant warm glow.  Pitt does likewise - he doesn't try to hog the glory but hangs around being smooth for most of the time.  This allows Pitt and Clooney to be the two leads without taking away from the ensemble feel - they also have a good relationship going here.  Roberts is OK but didn't convince me that Clooney would risk so much for her.  Affleck and Cann are good in a sort of comedy double act role - they don't have a lot of scenes but they are funny.  Old hands Gould (so good to see him on the big screen) and Carl Riener effortlessly steal all their scenes and Matt Damon seems happy to be on a smaller part than the other stars and has a rookie sort of role.  Andy Garcia has a poor role as the bad guy and doesn't manage to bring him to life - although he does make him unlikeable when next to Clooney.  However, Don Cheadle, a great actor, needs a real kicking for ruining things with a terrible cockney accent that makes Dick Van Dyke sound genuine.  Happily he doesn't actually have that many lines - and he only has two scenes where he has to say more than 2 sentences at a time - but really he is just terrible.  Someone please explain - why his character is English? Then someone explain - why they just didn't get an English star to play it?Overall any criticisms against this are minor and are missing the point. It's not meant to be a classic or get Sodenberg more Oscar nominations. Instead it's a slick little package that is kept afloat by a starry cast, a cool soundtrack and a nice (if silly) plot.  Sit, watch, chill, enjoy, forget."", ""A rarity--a remake that's better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it's light; yes, it's a trifle but it's so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy."", ""Throughout the past 6 months, heist films have been protruding our screens at a sporadic rate.  'The Score' starring Robert De Niro was one of the first out the gate last July, while David Mamet's highly praised 'Heist' was just released last month. Now, the Holiday season plays host to one of the most enjoyable films this year 'Ocean's 11'. Steven 'Do No Harm' Soderbergh's latest opus in a nutshell is absolutely fantastic. Watching the film I could see Warner Bros. tagging the lines for upcoming promos from all the reviews such as 'the most fun you'll have at the movies' and 'the year's best film'. For once, I would agree with those promos.  This is an absolute great piece of film. That is not to say that Soderbergh has not included a couple of clichÃ©d crowd pleasing segments, but that takes hardly anything away from a superbly acted, written and directed film. George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, who after just released from prison plans to concoct a daring caper to rob 3 Casinos for more than 150$ Million in cold cash. He therefore sets out to recruit, train and execute the plan which these three verbs respectively describing each of the film's three acts. First for recruitment is Brad Pitt who plays Dusty Ryan, a food-obsessed criminal who leads the plan with Clooney as they recruit Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and many more. Hence the title; 'Ocean's 11'. With his newest film, Soderbergh seems to return to his roots with his 'Out Of Sight' style he created when Jennifer Lopez and Clooney collaborated on that film in 1998. From the opening sequence when the camera tracks Clooney out of the prison gates, to the cutthroat dialogue in the same vein as 'out of Sight', I knew Soderbergh was onto something. The result is a great, fun, fast paced film that moves so fast at some parts that if you blink, you'll miss it. The opening 20 minutes have Danny and Rusty recruiting all over the U.S. with great scenes that prove to be the some of most memorable. Who can forget Elliot Gould's character Rubin Tischikoff as he tries to talk the men out of the heist by providing examples of the most successful Casino heists ever achieved - which turned out all to be unsuccessful. Those who saw the film know that the aforementioned scene is just one of the many scenes that work. If we look at the film in a dissecting fashion, we can clearly see that the film works on many levels. The first act quickly, easily and 'non-challantly' introduces us to our characters in a subtle detailed manner while simultaneously mocking the teen cover boys acting industry. Pitt is first approached from Clooney while he teaches teen stars on how to play cards. None other than Joshua Jackson, Holly Marie Combs and Topher Grace appear in this scene.  While the stars' presence can actually detract from what is another great scene in the film, just when you finish digesting that memorable scene, the film takes off a mere minutes after it starts with the recruitment of the Danny's 11 man-crew.The 'training' act explores several sub plots including the introduction of the Julia Roberts character Tess Ocean. She plays Ocean's ex-wife who is currently dating one of the Casino owners they are trying to rob. The incredibly underrated Andy Garcia plays the film's unconformist villain with suave sophistication who seems to convey the notion of fear with his droopy-eyed close ups. Tense scenes between Garcia and Clooney while rare, are simply a treat to watch. Furthermore, romantics will certainly enjoy the love subplot that is truly predictable that as clichÃ©d as it is, is still effective as only Soderbergh can create it to be.The third act is completely mind-blowing as the 'execution' of the robbery is filmed in such a dizzying, comedic yet suspenseful manner that makes this film stick out from all the other heist movies. The film's robbery sequence set during a Lennox Lewis fight is epic, grand and deserves to be viewed more than once to take it all in. While some might say the film ends in a clichÃ©d, predictable ending; I ask you, what did you expect? You are not going to get a sad ending with one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled for a motion picture. Furthermore, as a testament to Soderbergh's craftiness; witness the second to last closing scene. After all the frenzy, after all the comedy, and after all the intensity, Soderbergh assembles his cast right in front of the casino. The whole crew watches in a perverted sense of pride and accomplishment as they study the Casinos they just robbed with nostalgic music playing in the background; glamorizing their illegalities as only pure Hollywood magic can. They all take one last look at the Casinos, and slowly walk away one by one, each with a gaze of joy as they separate themselves from the 'job'. Truly an incredible scene that I played back in my mind repeatedly while writing this review, that one scene captures the true essence of the film. It still has to be seen as to whether or not any other film this year will come close to its' suaveness, its' look, its' style or its' satisfying effect it gives you when exiting the theatre. Pardon my colloquialism, but this film was damn cool. Notable mentions include the outstanding wardrobe. Seems as if Soderbergh simply wanted to make a film, put his actors in lavish sets and dress them up as good as he can. While some costumes may be outlandish to fit the character, Pitt's and Clooney's are simply stunning and had me looking through my GQ when I got home. Therefore, see it on the big screen and see it more than once to take in all the great elements this absolutely fantastic film had to offer.Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2"", 'Cheating the System In Oceans Eleven, cool colors are used throughout the entirety of the film because it helps calm the audience from then building suspense when the colors the actors are wearing are relaxing and soothing and because when the surroundings are not vibrant and explosive the mood seems to change and contradict the plot. However, Julia Roberts character, Tess, her clothing color choices are warm, which reveals the importance of her character.My experience with this film has always been an enjoyable one. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being at the local movie theater in town. I bought this movie when it first came out onto DVD for my sister. The cool colors that the actors wore, mostly blues and greens and browns, were very soothing to the viewer. The characters had to keep their ""cool"" throughout the film because they had to pull off the impossible feat which was attempting to purloin three huge casinos in Las Vegas. By wearing certain colors they were able to keep the audience under control and not cause any hyperventilation from the insane unending suspense. For example, throughout the planning and the first steps of the actual Bellagio robbery attempt, the characters were faced with a few major dilemmas. After they got the person inside the container and inside the vault, they noticed that the person had placed a briefcase on top of the container, and since his breathing time was running out the other characters were forced to figure out how to get him out of the box, without bumping off the briefcase and without setting off any of the alarms. With the cool color choices, the low key lighting, keeping the scenes darker, and the cool colors, the characters were able to pull it off, without being forced into frantic.The cold colors are not depressing at all due to the contradiction that they served. They were used throughout the film in not only the clothing choices but the scenery as well. All the furniture and props that were used all considered within the cool color range. They were all very relaxing and seemed very comfortable and soul soothing. For example, when they are in the room waiting for everything to follow through with the plan and waiting for the next person to do their part, the room has a ""cool"" feel.However, the cool colors, the blues, greens, and purples, weren\'t always used appropriately for say through out the film. As previously mentioned Tess\'s character threw off the serene feel that the other characters were attempting to produce. She was commonly found wearing red. She was drawing attention to herself in hopes to throw off her ex-husband and sidetrack him so that he wouldn\'t be able to finish his task even though she didn\'t know exactly what he was up to. She was a symbol of what was at stake for Danny, who was played by George Clooney. He could loose her again if this whole thing flops, conversely he doesn\'t have her back. Her vibrancy is an obstacle that is being forced upon Danny. The real challenge for Danny may possibly not be to rob the casinos, but to be able to do so without the interference of his ex.The movie Oceans Eleven has an overall uplifting theme that can make anyone smile.', 'I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That\'s not the case here.Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean\'s Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I\'ll just take this movie at face value.More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.That\'s the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other\'s thoughts and sentences hasn\'t been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they\'re the bad guys.Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up\'n\'coming\'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.Number Three: It\'s pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert â I\'ve been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that\'s part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we\'re so drawn into it, it\'s extremely enjoyable. That\'s due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what\'s happening on screen.Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, ""Good Morning"" seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses ""Good Morning."" I did it so much, that I didn\'t catch myself sometimes and some newbie\'s would tell me it was evening. I always replied, ""It\'s morning somewhere.""I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there\'s plenty more lines I absolutely love: ""Whiskey. And whiskey."" ""I only lied about being a thief and I don\'t do that anymore. â Steal? â Lie."" ""All reds!"" There\'s more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I\'m not familiar with. Though I can\'t necessarily follow what an ""Ella Fitzgerald"" is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie\'s intelligence.) It\'s nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven\'t before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right â Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated â it\'s 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn\'t just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean\'s Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact. SEE IT!', ""Spoilers herein.Ridley Scott's attention is focused on projecting each scene into the future; Soderbergh's is on the present, the zen of forgetting what's next. He pulls this off by immersion in the craft. Alone among major directors, he is a triple threat: he lives through the actor's eye; he works the director's end (as the variety of director that is storypuller); and he literally is the cameraman.This last is the special skill, because he seems able to accomplish this zen thing by making the camera flow. It is almost always godlike -- never taking a position or focal stance that a human would; but flowing like an invisible human observer might. The trick is that it is not just within a shot, as others would have, but seamlessly across great phrases of shots. This is architecture in the master builder sense.The story is throwaway except for two elements:--The method of shooting noted above is pure Kurosawa, and in particular `Seven Samuri.' And the story reflects it, with all the mechanics of collecting the team. Kurosawa himself collected actors from a single acting tradition and had them act as discrete characters. Soderbergh understands actors well enough to select actors from different traditions to act different types of characters. So we get a richer ensemble: Reiner's style is all timing; Clooney's all body; Pitt's heavily eye's; Julia's all mouth; Cheadle is a nervous projector; Garcia resolutely quite. (Pitt is the anchor of this film. He's really growing.)--As with all purely modern, postironic film, there is a film within, around which all things revolve. This film within the film is a carefully produced set piece where they fool the viewer. As with several other `casino' films -- particularly the self-referential `Snake Eyes' which is quoted here, there is a constant camera eye.It's very competent, cinematic storytelling. Someday soon, he'll do something important. And with his growing skill, it will alter lives."", ""***SPOILERS*** I watched this movie because the guy I was dating at the time sat me down one night and said I HAD to see it. I am so glad he did.This movie is a fun, silly respite from reality. You can tell by watching it that all of the people involved in the movie had fun making it.Brad Pitt and George Clooney have a great chemistry that shines. All the supporting cast not only work with that chemistry, but bring their own nuances to it.The plot is simple...let's go steal money from the casinos. You go into the movie KNOWING that they make it. The joy of the movie is watching the journey.It's not a perfect movie. I'm sure if I looked at the movie too critically, I could find hundreds of errors and flaws.I chose not to look that close, and recommend that you do the same."", 'I\'ve always had a low opinion of Frank Sinatra, so I\'ve never seen the original version of ""Ocean\'s Eleven"", but the remake was pretty neat. The plot of course has ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) getting eleven people to help him pull off a heist in Las Vegas. The neat factor mainly comes from their planning, which takes up most of the movie. Really cool performances from Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and everyone else, make this one neat movie. Apparently, it has a different ending than the original had, but obviously only those who have seen the original will even know that. Really cool. I have yet to see the sequel.', ""When you want to steal $160 million in cash from a huge casino in Vegas, you can either do it with force, or you can do it in a sneaky way. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang map out the casino and find a way to get down into the vault without anyone knowing what is going on until Rusty (Brad Pitt) calls the owner of the casino, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to state the terms. A large reason for the heist was that Benedict was going out with Danny's sexy ex-wife (Julia Roberts) and he wanted her back. The key to Danny and Linus (Matt Damon) getting into the vault was a device that Basher (Don Cheadle) stole, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the power of Las Vegas. Not many people would find a movie about stealing money entertaining, but the way that this one was made certainly can catch people's eye. I really think that it is one of the best of the new decade."", 'Why do modern movies not have original ideas? This movie is horrid. Everyone knows that this is a remake of the classic 1960 of the same name. There are so many things that are bad about this movie that I can only focus on the most egregious problems.First - NO CHEMISTRY. That character development is so bad that you end up rooting for the casino! They try to portray the casino owner, who\'s supposed to be Steve Wynn, as some kind of jerk. I found him to be a sympathetic character. In a heist picture, you are supposed to have sympathy for the crooks. Otherwise, they are just jerks who decide to steal because they are too lazy to make an honest living. Well the movie makes the bad guys look like jerks, and the casino out to be the hero. One wag once said, ""Rooting for the Yankee\'s is like cheering for the house to win in Blackjack."" I found myself cheering for the house.Second JULIA ROBERTS. She can\'t act, and is not beautiful. She is the source of the dramatic tension in the movie. I just don\'t get it.Third TOTALLY PREDICTABLE ENDING. You just knew that the cops coming into the building were fake, and would walk out with the loot. There are so many plot holes, that it strained credulity. The originals plot was more believable, and it was not supposed to be realistic.Fourth ACTORS LOOKED BORED. Clooney, Damon, and Roberts looked bored to tears. To me it was obvious that they were there to pick up a paycheck.Overall, horrid, bad, terrible, disjointed. The only rip-off in this movie is to the people who paid to see it in the theater, or worse bought the DVD. I can\'t believe they made two sequels to this turd.', ""Ocean's 11 (2001): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle: Disastrous remake starring George Clooney as a thief named Daniel Ocean (how clever). He is released from prison after serving time for being part of Batman and Robin, and immediately hooks up with fellow thief Brad Pitt to (ominous drum roll), rob a casino! The casino is owned by Andy Garcia playing Al Pacino and he is dating Julia Roberts who dumped Clooney due to his lifestyle. For every great film Steven Soderbergh makes he tops it with sh*t. For example, Traffic is terrific while Erin Brockovich is overrated garbage. One can suppose that this is his bad counter to his effective Out of Sight. The cast sleepwalk through the charade with Roberts embarrassing in her pitiful grinning in the backseat bull- crap when she accepts the redeeming Clooney. Yet we are suppose to be proud that they pulled together a cast that play like a high school class of roll call. The original film isn't much better with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin leading a large cast through the same charade. The remake is so much worse in its pointless bull and yet somehow this garbage managed to gain popularity. This is one that Soderbergh doesn't score high in terms of character driven writing, but it can claim to be one of the year's very worst films. Score: 0 / 10""]",/posters/xOcean's.jpg

Wrong!\n-The dialogue in this movie is just choppy and facetious. The most cringeworthy conversation to me was between Hoyt and the ugly bad dude.

It seems like they said every line in the movie thinking that it was deep and had an impact and was super important... but nothing was really needed for this movie. It could\'ve been filmed without speaking at all and the stupid story still would have come across.\n-I just didn\'t feel the relationship/love between the annoyingly mousy lead lady and the fish dude. She got on my damn nerves, really. So she brought the semi-sentient creature some boiled eggs that she made while she fapped in her bathtub (awkward and unnecessary). And meanwhile the entire f*cking building is on camera, but they never see her repeatedly sneaking in his sealed off room to feed him and even play music and dance for him?!?! serious cringe-fest right there. \n-the black lady Zelda ran her mouth all the time but yet everyone stepped all over her, including the lead (Sally I think? I\'m trying hard to forget this stupid movie). Couldn\'t she ever tell Zelda a simple ""thank you"" for all the millions of times Zelda stepped up for her, made sure she ate, translated for her, punched her time card for her, lied for her, etc? Not once did Sally show gratitude. It\'s like Sally is a weird, selfish person that became infatuated with a dude that looks like Thane from Mass Effect 2 (yet Thane was 1,000 times more of a fleshed out character than this ""god fish"") and everyone just helped the anorexic mouse lady because she ""found true love."" No one thought this was f*cking weird?? She meets a semi-intelligent FISH in a lab tank and bangs him and has a sick puppy love for him and everyone in the movie acted like that was completely normal. Seriously? In what world is bestiality normal? Just completely idiotic.\n-Soooo many unnecessary and useless scenes. Who cares about the mean dude (Michael Shannon) not liking noise and furiously banging his weird Stepford Wife missionary style while he covers her mouth and continually tells her to shut up? And when he got his new Cadillac car with the weird salesman and all the useless banter about its color being ""teal"" not ""green?"" Or the scene with Sally furiously water-fapping while she makes boiled eggs for the weird fish dude? or where M Shannon pees in front of the 2 ladies without holding his d*ck? \nI could go on and on forever and rip this movie to shreds, but I\'m already annoyed and tired from writing all this. This movie was completely and utterly stupid, and I wish I could have my time and money back. Fail, del Toro. Big stupid fail. Ugh.', ""Diabetics beware, you're in for a saccharine flavoured heap of mush.The Shape of Water was directed/created by Guillermo Del Toro best known for creepy and violent films such as Pan's Labyrinth and more mainstream writings such as Hellboy and The Hobbit. For some reason he has had a dose of the lovestrucks and written a film that is basically Amelie meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. There are a couple of questionable violent scenes (torturing a dying man by dragging him around via a bullet wound to the cheek had a touch of the old GDT that we know and love) but the plot literally has no surprises whatsoever. I picked the minor twist about 10 minutes in, and spent the second half of the film waiting for it to be over. I am sorry to say the only interesting part was the reveal (not literally) of the sea creature's penis via the main character's description which is frankly hilarious. Octavia Spencer does a fantastic job of playing herself (Was this woman born middle aged?) but let's face it we love her anyway. I would love her to be my best friend, she's a hoot.Michael Shannon (whom I remember from Take Shelter and Boardwalk Empire) plays a creepy bad guy in a way that makes me never want to have him around for Christmas lunch. Why does he always play someone sexually awkward? I pray we'll never find out. I was most disappointed that unlike Pan's Labyrinth and some of the other films GDT has made it's not set in a fantastical different world. It's basically the 1950s cold war era in USA with no real pretense of being anything but. I was hoping for a magical realism, but other than the creature, there's no otherworldliness to it. I am a solid romantic, but I found the plot so saccharine that it made me feel nauseous. There is also a sudden musical number that almost had me running for the aisle, and my sister desperate to see my husband's face (He's allergic to musicals generally). Apart from this light relief, I couldn't wait to get out of there.I am pretty alone in this opinion, our party was split between 3 people who loved it, and my husband and I who hated it. Maybe if I hadn't seen other GDT films I would have liked it more. My husband also thought the trailer completely misrepresented what he expected from the film. So maybe we were in the wrong movie. But I think romance lovers won't like the art house element, and art house/GDT fans won't like this film. So I think commercially it will be hard to place."", 'This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a magnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from Sally Hawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, clichÃ© and cartoon supporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash up of ""E.T."", ""Splash"" and ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"", as an aquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military American laboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and Sally Hawkins\' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls in love.Sounds interesting, doesn\'t it? It certainly has potential, but if the sassy black friend, constantly yammering on about her feckless husband (Octavia Spencer, surely tiring of this kind of role) doesn\'t get you, or the inefficient gay neighbour/best friend (Richard Jenkins - not his finest two hours) or Michael Shannon\'s cartoonish, 2D villain, then stay tuned for the ghastly black-and-white fantasy dance number, in which Hawkins and the creature cavort on an elaborate set like Astaire and Rogers. It truly is a ghastly mis-step, jaw-droppingly stupid. The film never really recovered for me, and it lumbered to its predictable climax and ending with numbing melodramatics and sentiment.', ""While the basic premise of this King Kong-ish plot, the lead acting (with the exception of the stereotypical and WAY overplayed villain), and the recreation of the 60's time period are all somewhat worthy (three stars worth), there are many oddly-forced and clunky scenes all of which impede the storytelling flow and represent a serious distraction: Gratuitous gore (rotting fingers, headless kitty), homosexual innuendo, masturbation, a bathroom that will hold 7 feet of water by simply closing the door and putting a towel under it, inter-species love at first sight sexual attraction and off-screen consummation, and a Saturday-Night-Live-like song and dance skit (?), among several others. Even with the love-conquers-all 'happy ending' and a beautifully depicted submerged in water embrace final scene,' overall it doesn't digest well.P.S. The shill-like adoration of just the titles alone (!) of most of the 10/10 user ratings for this film are absurdly hilarious, their effusively giddy text even more so."", ""G. Del Toro has been frequently fawned over as a 'masterful story teller'. I found nothing 'masterful' about it. I absolutely could not hook in to this film. It made no logistical sense at all. It also had a dark and cartoonish feel to it like a Bat Man film. The setting in which the story takes place is deeply flawed. Eliza (the dumb one), and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work as cleaning ladies in a so-called top secret facility when there seems to be nothing top-secret about it.The cleaning pair wander at will throughout the facility and discover it's also 'top-secret' biological specimen with no clearance at all. Right.And low and behold, the biological specimen is none other than the Creature from the Black Lagoon! This time in living color and many upgrades.One might also notice Octavia Spencer is appearing in every other bomb out of Hollywood as a supporting actress and nothing more. Maybe in ten years they'll give her one of her own movies. Not holding my breath.Back to the Creature. We'll call him Creatch for short. The homely Eliza has a strict routine of hard boiling eggs while she masturbates furiously in her bathtub every morning. Eliza is fundamentally scared to death of normal men. She then brings the food to Creach, which she eventually falls in love with.Creach is super duper intelligent and can instantly learn English, American sign language and writing, but likes to savagely dine on the occasional domesticated cat here and there. Right.Creach also has super powers. He can almost instantly heal bodily wounds, as well as restore hair to a bald man. Alright, that one small bit I found pretty cool, but that's it. Eliza eventually decides to kidnap Creach, for his own good, so she can turn him loose into the ocean just one step ahead of Russian Agents who have infiltrated the facility for the soul purpose of killing him. Again, not a very top-secret organization.Shortly after that, Eliza and Creach begin having sex. That's right. An otherwise normal woman gets it on with a humanoid looking fish that looks like it dried out in the oven too long. Happens all the time I guess.The two subplots involving a sadistic head of security and an alcoholic neighbor who works as a graphics artist are barely even worth mentioning.And the ending? Beyond impossible.This story is strictly reserved for the over-emotional, over-romantic, and completely naÃ¯ve.Go see it if you really want to, but you have been warned."", ""I was really excited to watch this as I had heard it was at least nominated. Now all I wish is to have those two hours of my life back. I do agree that the movie had a very original story line, but I was disturbed and completely let down. The movie was very slow moving and boring. For the most part it was very predictable just like every other romantic movie. What disturbs me is this movie was meant to be set in a time where homosexuals and people of colour weren't accepted to society yet somehow, and this astounds me people were fully accepting with the fact that she falls in love and has sex with a fish! After finding out it won 4 awards i no longer trust that people know a good movie when they see one. Overall, it was a waste of my time and I would never recommend it to a friend, in fact I would only recommend NOT seeing it."", 'I have seen tons of crap movies, believe me, but none of them is bad enough to make me register an account on IMDB just to write a review. But after watching this, I have the urge to express my utterly disgust. Thank you, Del Toro, for that, by the way.The movie is simply stupid. The storyline is deeply flawed. The only thing the movie challenges the audience is our intelligence. Well i do not expect a Hitchcock movie, we can accept flaws here and there as long as it does not affect the story and fits the characters. But the movie is self contradicting and the characters behaviors are so bizarre it is just so intelligently insulting. So a cleaning lady can steal the ""most valuable asset"" from the ""top secret facility"" which is only guarded by on single soldier and does not even have a moving vehicle to chase after the invaders. They can just park the van downstairs for three or four days and no one thinks about looking for the van. Actually there is no one looking into this at all. From beginning to the end there is only the bad villain alone who is not doing anything but stay in the office and interrogate the cleaning ladies, only after 48 hours he thought about talk to the doctor who refused to kill the monster in the first place. Is this US military? It\'s easier than rob a bank. If i were Elisa, I\'ll go rob the Fed. But Elisa is not so smart, she made up the entire plan without thinking about how to unchain the fish dude without a key. And please what is the point of keeping the weaking, dying fish dude in ur home? Waiting to be discovered? Come on, Baltimore is by the sea!! There is literally a dock in the city center. Okay so you want to have sex with him, can you please do it at the back of the van on the way to Mexico? And the police ( ya, still no sign of military) showed up when the government officer died and they watched the suspect left? On and on i could go but i think you get the point.Let\'s look at the characters, as a ""romantic love"" story, you did not explain to me how the lady fell in love with the fish dude? Are you telling me because she\'s a minority, and ""he"" is a minority, so the director thinks it needs no further explanation for her to fell in love with the fish? How did she overcome the fear of his monster looking? How did he understand her? Or it\'s just her sick, petty love makes her thinks he understands and loves her? There are many ways to show and build up the emotions but the director shows none at all! And is it just me that find it super weird that the lady did not show any form of gratitude, not even an attitude, to her friend at all? It\'s just so inhuman and fake.The dialogue is also a disaster.Choppy and facetious, they tried to say something sounds smart and deep but actually just irrelevant and award. Like the ""universe"" thing coming from the general, what is that about? And there are so many random scenes that just make me question the ability of the director. What\'s the point of showing the doc realising the russian agents are plotting against him when in the end he stills shows up like there\'s nothing wrong??? Who cares about the villian buying a car from a random salesman(who seems to be the only smart man in the show) and not like talking when banging his wife? What is the point of all this?As for the cinematography, esthetics effect, etc, there is nothing to talk about. I don\'t find it ""touching"" or ""romantic"" in any single way. The costume on the fish dude looks like just some random monster from a superhero movie, not even the carefully designed big boss, but those minions who are ready to be smashed by the HULK. I feel deeply disappointed that such a film could win the academy. So it has the elements of minority, LGBT, african americans, protecting the environment, evil russians and selfish government, so it must win??!As a conclusion, i feel insulted by the director and the academy. Its winning lowered the average IQ of the entier Los Angeles.', 'Kafka once wrote: ""There is hope, but not for man..."". If the sate of man is such that The Shape of Water receives an Oscar for \'Best Picture\', then really, to me, all hope is lost.', ""Just one honest question. If you watched the film, just reverse the roles. Female creature and male dumb average looking guy. Do not change anything at all. I rest my case. Now after the idea above, where how disgusted you will feel on the idea of a male masturbating man kidnapped a female fish girl, something about the film.The film does takes you away from reality and as soon as you start enjoying the film the story slaps you on the face with something completely irrelevant and shock(still irrelevant). Over the top villain, the research, the stupidity ( if you think its a Russian spy who can stay in the water for so long and does not look like understand anything, just keep it in captivity), the finger , the overuse of painkillers where at one point the infection is so bad that he pulls the finger off but dont feel the pain, the waiting of the tide , instead of going directly to the nearest open sea they took him home, loves the humans but kills the cat( to my logic cat and human both are food for him), bath scene of holding water where water supply was more than the leak to fill the bathroom up temporarily, fishman sudden discovery of immense power and healing and converting a human to fishgirl but in lab just enough to bite off a finger? so means less than a dog, lead girl brainy enough the plan someone smuggle out of top secret lab but not enough to find a sea spot for him to immediately escape in open waters. \nBasically she was just a pervert who wanted the creature for her own pleasure but just couldn't get to it. At the end when she was shot, I felt happy and relieved. I even wanted him to carry on shooting to make sure she is dead.

The writing was awful, the idea was awful, the flow was awful. It was shot like a surreal farce with this candy cane music throughout that just made it even more unrealistic than it already was. If it isn't bizarre enough to be about a cleaning lady that falls in love with the creature from the black lagoon, then it got even worse. At one point she ends up dancing and singing with the creature in some kind of Broadway musical! What?

It's not well written. It's not well paced. It's not entertaining.\nI had high expectations in this movie, being Oscar winner and by Del Toro and all. But unfortunately it turned out to be a massive on screen disaster and frown fest, a big mess. It starts beautifully though with a nice underwater intro. The it's only getting worse. We see the daily morning routine of the mute cleaner who strangely reminds us of a sad and disturbed version of AmÃ©lie, Del Toro maybe had in mind a similar quirky, sensitive and charming character. Something went terribly wrong. The cleaner has a gay artist neighbour and a bestie at work, played charmingly by Octavia Spencer, unfortunately her role is just a stereotype of the slightly overweight, loyal side kick with a heart of gold. Then we meet the antagonist, played by Michael Shannon, another stereotype, white male sadistic mean pervert military guy with a heart of stone. Yaaawn. The fish man the cleaner falls for is basically the creature from the black lagoon. Why does the cleaning lady start having romantic feelings for the black lagoon creature? Because he can't speak either and they both like boiled eggs, so they have something in common, perfect match, ok? Does Del Toro really believe lonely women at a certain age are that desperate?\nDel Toro uses same filters and production design as in Hellboy. The background is America in the 50s with style and music reminding not only console players strongly of Fallout or Bioshock. The ballroom scene in black and white is from the Artist. \nThere is no original good idea in the movie, we've seen it all before, but better. \nWhy did it get Best Film Oscar? Maybe there is deeper political reason for this, I have no other explanation. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

Watched it because it won best picture, it didn't deserve to even be on that list. So unbelievably bad. Don't watch."", ""I heard this film was strange, but very good, so I was excited to watch it. I love films with romance in, and even if one of the leads was a fish man, I was willing to be open minded and go with the flow.What a waste of time.There were so many flaws and strange scenes in this movie that I couldn't enjoy it. For a start, I never really felt the connection between the leading lady and the fish man. She gave him some boiled eggs and seemed to kind of like that he couldn't speak either, and then the next moment we are meant to believe they are deeply in love. I didn't see or feel any real tenderness - just a silly girl who had a school girl style crush. I found the scenes where she was naked in the bath in the beginning completely unnecessary to the story line and awkward. Was that just to gratify male viewers? I didn't understand what the scenes where she was masturbating were meant to add to the plot either - so she's a woman and likes to masturbate....so what? It just wasn't relevant. She came across as vapid and I didn't see her show any gratitude towards her best friend at work, who repeatedly lied and risked her lift for her! Like I said, I went into this with an open mind because the story requires you to do so. But there were loads of unbelievable moments which again were just not necessary and could have been made more realistic: pulling a grown man along the ground by a bullet hole in his cheek, filling an entire bathroom with water like a swimming pool just by putting a towel on the floor by the door...and not worrying that her fish man would be found out caught by authorities when water starts pouring into the theatre below, remaining standing in the bathroom when the door is opened and the water rushes out, not releasing the fish man into the sea immediately but waiting for the rain to fill the canal up first - why? The sea was right there! Also her friends have literally no problem with her having sex with the fish man at all. Everyone finds it really normal. And that musical scene...there are no words. I could go on. For me this movie just fell flat. I thought that at the very least it would be more shocking than it was, but you never actually see anything happen between the lead and the fish man. So if you were going to watch it for the shock and ewww factor, just don't even bother because there's none of that either.""]",/posters/xThe.jpg

The characters aren't original. I guess the younger crowd and die hard fans will probably like it but as an avid movie fan Guardians kind of disappointed me. Acting was kind of terrible too. Bautista played Drax as if Drax was TRYING to sound intelligent. He couldn't pull off the smart brute. Zoe tried too hard to be bad a$$ and it wasn't natural. The Collector... Don't get me started... What reason was there for The Collector to even open and show anybody the Infinity Stone? It's a super powerful object that he knew was very powerful, why show Thanos' daughter or the outlaw? The bad guys were the worst, so campy. Ronin reminded me of a pro wrestler during an interview. Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed. Booooring.... The movie wasn't terrible but after reading the super reviews on IMDb, I had to say something."", ""This movie is a mess of the worst kind: a never-ending cascade of contrivance after contrivance.The plot, if it could be called so, is kickstarted by the theft of a magical plot device that evil people want. This also happens in The Avengers and Man of Steel, and it's not getting any more creative. The evil people fight the good guys, there's explosions and snarky humor everywhere, and it never rises above the level of an excuse plot. Characters get beaten close to death so the movie can have a sad moment before they get revived - all the protagonists are invincible. There's one particularly shameful scene where a character gets cast out into space and another character risks death to save them. But surprise! Somehow, a fleet of spaceships somewhere managed to find their exact location and arrive to save both within a minute! See, friendship saves the day again!The dialog is just as useless as the plot: the characters either make juvenile jokes, exposit once again that they need to bring the magical plot device somewhere in order to prevent genocide by the evil guy (in case the audience forgot), have ham-fisted discussions about the value of friendship and overcoming adversity with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, or explain completely obvious things. The worst of this is when a character steps out into a visibly darkened corridor and comments on how dark it is.I saw this movie because it was compared to one of my favorites: The Fifth Element. This comparison is worthless because while The Fifth Element was a movie, The Guardians of the Galaxy is a product. Every bombastic special effect and every cardboard cutout character reek of a movie trying to sell itself and its tie-in action figures and comic books to 12-year old kids. The humor is juvenile, the plot and characters are shallow and facile, explosions and fighting are shoehorned in at every turn... there is no natural characterization, no genuine emotion, and no signs of intelligence. This movie is junk food cinema at its worst. We deserve better."", 'So , I was yesterday to see this ""big"" movie, which has a rating of 8.7, close to ""The lord of the rings"" movies, the same as ""Matrix"" or ""Inception"" and even better than ""Seven"" or ""Usual suspects"". It should be good right? Doesn\'t matter that Marvel made only crap movies, most of them anyway, with a few exceptions, some of the first Spiderman movies and some X-men movies, maybe they nailed it this time.So, the movie starts and after the first scenes, we see our hero on an abandoned planet, dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for. He is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset, someone may be nearby. Anyway, he got what he came for, and the scene is very similar to the one in Indiana Jones. No surprise, this entire movie is a rip -off of other movies, you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys (Star wars), you have a pair, a raccoon and a tree, only the raccoon understands the tree (Star wars), again, our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the female(again.... Star wars), only in Star Wars, the process was more real and more fun. Also, like other Marvel movies, the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments. Gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power, tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship, while Peter Quill and the others were waiting for Gomora to cut the damn power. Another stupid moment was when Ronan, at last he lands, but he doesn\'t destroy the planet, the thing he wanted the most to do, no, he looks at our hero dancing... speechless... And how did Drax survived when he and Ronan are hit by a ship at full speed, piloted by raccoon?So, Guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects, explosions after explosions, characters that are poorly written, actors that don\'t act very well, a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies.Conclusion, another boring movie by Marvel, highly over rated, I don\'t know how, I think Marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day.You wanna see a good sci-fi movie, watch any of the Star Wars movies.', 'In a previous review, one writer said that Marvel could have ""played it safe, but went into a bold new direction"".Well I don\'t know about you, but filling a movie with pop culture references to hook the money-spending adult-child demographic of 30 and 40 somethings, in what is quite literally ""just another sci-fi adventure"", is NOT taking a risk.From the very minute the film started I knew I was going to be manipulated in the most direct way, but even then sometimes you ask for it, like watching ""Old Yeller"" for example. But in the case of GOTG, it\'s pretty much shoveled in our mouths from the beginning, and with more than a spoonful of sugar.Some have compared this movie to Star Wars (which it\'s not), and even while that film was derivative of Saturday morning serials and classic science fiction films and TV, what made Star Wars unique is the creative ways it tips it\'s hat at the genre, and more specifically how hard everyone worked to make it their own. There was more depth to it, and it left you wondering, ""didn\'t we see that in something else""? However GOTG embellishes with pop culture, very much like the roller-coaster ride operator who turns on the top 40 or R&B station while he locks you in your seat. That\'s not creating something unique, it\'s hopping on the back of something that\'s previously established, and it takes no effort to do so, only money.But don\'t take my word for it, see for yourself. In going through the other reviews, on almost every page someone writes their summary as ""Hooked on a Feeling"". If that doesn\'t resemble Pavlov\'s Dog, I don\'t know what else could.I DID like Guardian\'s of the Galaxy for it\'s art design, effects, stunts, sound design, and the battered underscore by Tyler Bates which was brilliant. But with scenes in which we have Chris Pratt making Kevin Bacon sound like a universal liberator of man during a romantic scene with Zoe Saldana, (and who references his name later in the film like a punch line) this movie is the epitome of that age old prediction, ""Pop Will Eat Itself"".Speaking of Pratt, I felt he\'s probably the weakest leading man I\'ve ever encountered in a blockbuster film. He felt like a composite of Indiana Jones, Norma Rae and Oliver Twist all mixed into one. I cared not a single moment for his well being, his past or even his future. So no, Marvel didn\'t play it safe. Not by a long shot. They knew what they were doing when they licensed these songs, filled the dialog with prime time nods and then threw a bunch of fireworks at us. Not having read the comic, if these same kinds of references are in there, I\'m sure I will find out soon enough. But that just reinforces my argument anyway, and leaves one to ask if we should expect more depth of storytelling, character development and not-so-easy references to day to day life from big budget features (I do!), or is it safe to say that today\'s blockbuster films will sacrifice originality for commonality and we should just go with it?Either way, since this is obviously the first in a new franchise, I\'m sure we will find out what Marvel\'s priorities are in the next installment. Let\'s hope it\'s not just ""The next Empire Strikes Back"".', ""With each new film they release, Marvel outdo themselves time after time, from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now to this amazing and irreverent superhero space opera packed full of humour and action in a visually stunning galaxy. Admittedly, I have slowly become more and more bored with superhero films since the high point of DC's 'The Dark Knight' and Marvel's 'Avengers', however 'Guardians' was something that was truly different, something that truly blew me away and has, as a result, become what is arguably my favourite Marvel film. Previous Marvel films have tried too hard to place humour in situations that didn't require it, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' however employs it frequently and due to the constant stream of jokes it works perfectly. Chris Pratt is by far one of Marvel's best casting choices since Robert Downey Jr. as 'Iron Man', even beyond this the other acting bodies were cast perfectly. The visual effects are utterly stunning and the battle scenes are epic, 'Guardians' is a truly amazing and thrilling superhero flick full of visual splendour."", 'I\'ve never seen so bad movie since ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".... HOW?HOW can this movie has a rating above 8?? From the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess! Childish plot, childish characters and awful, AWFUL humor ALL the times !! Even in the ""serious"" and ""important"" scenes there\'s always a stupid joke to ruin the moment(which is already ruined but anyway..). countless clichÃ©s and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells! The CGI where just OK and the fight scenes were at best indifferent..there were also some slo-mo scenes with nothing really to offer,i mean it\'s like a guy jumping in slow motion...seriously!nothing cool about it nothing new!Nothing about this movie is new or original! I have nothing else to say for this ""movie""..stay away!', ""As a fan of Marvel movies I was excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy. However, this movie failed on several levels.It is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny. I genuinely laughed once. Furthermore, one 'joke' was weirdly inappropriate.The story is completely generic. It seems like they just needed some story, any story, as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny.I wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big set-piece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out. This was done in the Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness. To me, it's like directors have to have this '9/11' shot in every movie (big thing crashes into buildings) and it has to stop. It's boring now.The only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds.It seems that Marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack. I will approach the next Marvel with extreme caution, and I will not see Guardians of the Galaxy 2."", 'Guardians of the Galaxy is just another mediocre film. Under the pretence of future, it sneaked in embraces of the past. Perhaps it tried to be both, but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy. It failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me. Its humour was out of context. There were too many characters, most of which were not properly developed. The purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing. I\'ll comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs.Someone commented that the films like the Dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful. That person further commented that this film, Guardians of the Galaxy challenged this standard. I generally don\'t like dogmas. But here it\'s not at all about dogmas. It is just the fact that those ""deep"" ones could trigger deeper emotions, or provoke thoughts, or inspire the audiences, or help the audiences learn something, or help the audiences learn themselves better. By these, the audiences like, think about, involuntarily recall, remember and give high scores for those ""deep"" films. Of course different people have different opinions on deepness. So, I don\'t comment on the deepness of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just commenting on triggering deeper emotions, or provoking thoughts, or inspiring me, or helping me learn something or learn myself better, unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy did none of these to me. So, it just didn\'t make me feel that way, that it was one of those all-time great films.Someone commented that Guardians of the Galaxy was not a serious film, but rather, it was a great, light-hearted comedy. Even for this, I don\'t think I could agree. Great humour exists in context. In the right context, something plain could be hilarious. Out of context, brilliant jokes were just nothing. In Guardians of the Galaxy, too much humour ran out of context. For example, the raccoon said later, that he asked for one prisoner\'s prosthetic leg was just a joke. What did this convey? It was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? No. How about it tried to portray a figure, the raccoon, who was unfazed in front of great danger? But then you had to make the situation look dangerous. Even in The Wizard of Oz (1939), the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison. The prison here felt just like a noisy second-hand market. So, I didn\'t find the joke funny and didn\'t know why it was in the film otherwise either. There were many such lines. I knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh, but I just didn\'t feel that entertained at those improper moments.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy has no place on the all-time great list. Perhaps it was the last joke it could play, on itself, being put into the Top 250 list. Among those great films, its mediocrity would just manifest itself. Just within the first month of its release, it dropped 20 places on the Top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th. As time goes on, this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge. There are great films, like In the Name of the Father (1993), A Beautiful Mind (2001) etc. They were not on the Top 250 list before, but gradually rose up and emerged into the all-time great list. Just on the contrary, Guardians of the Galaxy will gradually drop out of the Top 250 list.', ""I thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star, even though it's maybe - at BEST - a 4, because this is definitely not worth 8. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a shot I chose to try in god knows how long since I've been to the cinema. This is just another load of Hollywood trash. I had the impression it was innovative, considering the Guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing... but I was wrong...IN THE BEGINNING, what's-his-name is on Earth and it is APPARENTLY '88. The kid's mother dies. OK. Is this meant to be emotional despite the fact I have no attachment to any of these characters yet? OH WOW IT'S THE FUTURE NOW!! I'm sorry; his mother dies, he goes outside and then he gets abducted? What is this supposed to signify? Not to mention it's (obviously) unbelievably and strangely timed, but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character, but really doesn't do ANYTHING for the major plot of the entire film.The rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison (because what happens when you're arrested together is you share a block, not to mention gender is no issue here). Then they fall into this orb situation. What is it? It.. it is this orb.. and it is powerful.. a bit like the cube or something. There was little development in the story at all really, a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising. I don't even know, I was almost asleep half the time. I was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over.So we have hideous CGI here. Ridiculously unprofessional, but I guess I'm not in with the CGI in blockbusters. They have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems; having the ability to do these things doesn't make it cool, it just looks like a video game. Another thing, visually, was the designs. It was just so typical of the action/sci-fi genre in the technology and whatnot, and the characters... very much in the same boat but more-so thrown together effortlessly.Then after that its all EXPLOSIONS - SPEEDING - ADVERTISING - HITTING! In between there's a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe. The best kind. And in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay.OVERALL: >The comedy was... horrid... >The story was simple. >The characters were lacking in... everything really. -The cinematography didn't even involve cameras. >The soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together. So what was good about it? The ACTION!!!1111 Wait, no... >The action was too much, unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time. Main reason I even saw this was I received an invitation from some mates. I think I'll try go back to sticking to films with a point. The only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucks."", 'I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn\'t mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichÃ©s extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it\'s Marvel, what could go wrong? It\'s sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it\'s all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it\'s a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It\'s not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I\'d rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I\'m not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichÃ©s...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of ""saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it\'s not just Earth that\'s being targeted this time so ha we are different"" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana\'s pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a clichÃ©-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure.So, plot: Would have been old and good but it wasn\'t. Protagonists: I would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didn\'t blow up almost everyone\'s favorite guy and kept alive some people\'s least-liked guy(s). So, yeah. Villains: ... oh my gosh, no, seriously? What even happened to the evil robot woman? Did the filmmakers just completely forget her? Music: Louder than Inception\'s horn. And I loved that even though it had no tune. Couldn\'t stand this though. But still, be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that I would have downloaded if they didn\'t play those songs during totally inappropriate moments. Comedy relief my butt. The only relief I got out of the soundtrack that isn\'t even their soundtrack -hopefully they didn\'t violate any copy rights... I mean, if it\'s these filmmakers, I wouldn\'t be surprised- is that I\'m glad Groot enjoyed himself. Visuals: Stunning. That wasn\'t sarcastic at all. At all. What else? Oh yeah, unless you pay me a million dollars, I would never watch the sequel. So sorry I can\'t contribute ten dollars for Marvel next time. Tough luck.Don\'t let this review stop you though. Most of my friends liked it. And of course, most people who reviewed this movie liked it, so I guess I\'m just a jerk. I\'m betting you readers agree, and that\'s totally understandable since I am totally venting. But hey, three out of four of my friends never watched a Marvel movie so... call me bluffing, but I sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments I have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life.... I\'m still going to watch X-men though. Dang you, Marvel.', 'This film was like the story of "" The Emperor\'s New Clothes"", where the con artists create an invisible suit and just to fit in everyone in the village inducing the king say they like the suit. Parts of the film were enjoyable and the film BUT this film is not better than the 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bicycle Thief, Rashamon, Toy Story, Chinatown, Up, Pan\'s Labyrinth, The Hunt, Ikuru, Good Will Hunting, Blade Runner, Rebecca, Casino, V for Vendetta, Fargo, Trainspotting, Into the wild, Dial M for Murder, The Sixth Sense, The Thing, No Country for Old Men, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Incendies, Network, Diabolique, There Will Be Blood, Amores Perros, The Wizard of Oz, Million Dollar Baby, The Avengers, he Bourne Ultimatum, Strangers on a Train, Twelve Monkeys, Notorious, The King\'s Speech, The Terminator, Rocky, Dog Day Afternoon, Monsters, Inc., Memories of Murder, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Die Hard, etc', ""If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then, after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley Kubrick."", 'So - my son and I went to watch GotG. After reading mixed reviews we were skeptical but curious. The bad reviews unfortunately were right. The movie has no story line, stupid characters (like a talking raccoon) and more bad language than most rated R films I have seen. The producers were trying to cover the lack of plot with senseless action scenes that all seemed random and disconnected. Do yourself a favor and save the money you spend - you will get more pleasure from a big cup of ice cream. I can\'t believe Glenn Close and Vin Diesel took even small roles in this.My sons\' quote: "" I totally agree with my dad. There was no point in making this movie. The movie is overly dramatic for instance; in the beginning of the movie Starlords mom dies from cancer and she asked him to hold her hand while she dies, and he looks away and cries. Then after she dies he runs out of the hospital and gets kidnapped by aliens. The characters are really badly made, like the evil blue dude who has a half robot daughter that just stands around him like an eavesdropping servant or the madman who just tries to kill Ronan - so a lot of this movie is stupid. We left the theater half way through.', 'Such an awful wreck! There I said it. These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a ""fantastic"" and ""great"" and ""awesome"" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The ""Ten out of Ten"" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it\'s obvious out of the five, there\'s Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don\'t worry it can understand what you\'re saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He\'s the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there\'s a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say...""okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?"" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn\'t he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What\'s even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there\'s no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where\'s his real accent? Though I would have to say he\'s not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it\'s humanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista as Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall performance (if any) Why? Well, you\'ll be sharing this characters maniacal laughter once you\'ve realized you wasted valuable devotion for a franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions rather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his quirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect trio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the threatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT COULD GO WRONG...oh I don\'t know... Let\'s start predicting before we start watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It\'s PG-13, so no, but is there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a film! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZEROIf you expect a disappointment, you\'re welcome. If you\'re an oblivious fanatic that just loves hearing and reading the same regurgitated lines, you\'re in for a whirlwind!Good Luck Marvel in your festival of delusion!

HalloweenÂ (1978) ,(1978),7.8,1h 31min,"['Horror', 'Thriller']",R,"Fifteen years after murdering his sister on Halloween night 1963, Michael Myers escapes from a mental hospital and returns to the small town of Haddonfield to kill again.",John Carpenter,John Carpenter,"['Donald Pleasence,', 'Jamie Lee Curtis,', 'Tony Moran']","['I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90\'s can\'t hold a candle to 70\'s and 80\'s horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don\'t know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday\'s so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don\'t rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don\'t need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don\'t. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can\'t be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It\'s the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don\'t know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, "" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. "" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn\'t. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn\'t. But it\'s astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock\'s steps, maybe director\'s should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don\'t know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won\'t let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don\'t know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90\'s, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven\'s final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie\'s version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn\'t take away from the brilliance of this one.', ""John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.This was the first and without doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining point in the late great Donald Pleasence's career. A true classic."", ""Halloween(1978)stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Donald Pleasance, and, among others, P.J. Soles(the cap-brat from Carrie). The story centers around the demented/catatonic-schizophrenic Michael Myers and the brutal, cold-blooded murder of his oldest sister in 1963(done by him). Now it is fifteen years later and Michael has escaped the sanitarium and is headed for Haddonfield, Illinois, home of Laurie Strode(Curtis), his sister who was adopted shortly after the 1963 murder. Laurie has no idea about her past and wanders around with her friends, seemingly free of worry, and unaware that her every step is under careful watch from hiding eyes.In the long run I am at a loss for words. Everything is here. And it's even terrifying...and a slasher movie, what a combination. Slasher movies, to me, usually aren't scary. But Halloween is. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet you are really missing out. It's a rare achievement in film history and is one of the best horror movies ever made. It's a perfect 10/10 all the way!!!"", ""I must have watched this movie a hundred times or more, apart from being possibly the greatest horror movie of all time, it's a damn good movie in its own right. Fantastic story, really well acted, plus it has one of the best musical scores I have ever heard. How many films can boast a soundtrack that can evoke such feelings as Halloween? not many. 37 years later and it's as watchable today as it was back then. Talk about getting the acting balance spot on, Jamie Lee Curtis made the perfect victim, brilliantly set against Michael Myers, the perfect bad guy, and Donald Pleasance was utterly flawless as Doctor Loomis. I hadn't realised just how good Donald Pleasence was in this film, the speech he made was almost iconic.It plays on so many of our fears, the young Michael in a clown mask, still as shocking today as it was back then. The thought of the bogeyman following you home, waiting on a street corner for you etc, the list is endless.I cannot believe having just watched it the lack of blood and gore, goes to show it simply didn't need it, it's the suspense and fear that creates the horror.There have been so many rip offs and 'homages' to Halloween, but there will only ever be one King of the Horror films, and that's Halloween! Thank you John Carpenter. 10/10"", ""Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is all terrific. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!"", ""Halloween directed by John Carpenter, the movie that started the decade trend of slasher films.Halloween tells the story of Michael Myers( Nick Castle ), who stabbed his 15-year old sister on Halloween night when he was 6-years old. After being locked up in a mental institution for 15 years, he escapes and begins to stalk a group of high school babysitters. The only character who knows of Michael's capabilities is his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) believes that Michael is not a human, but an incarnation of evil that will perform acts of murder of eternity. Loomis knows Michael better than anyone else. No one else understands Michael's true capabilities and thinks that Loomis is just being paranoid. Even though Loomis searches for Michael, he is unsuccessful in stopping Michael for most of the film and has little effect on story until the end. Loomis only exist to provide exposition and insight into Michael's actions. Michael Myers is less of a man and more of a force of nature in physical form. Michael is shown to know how to drive or disable the power to a house, even though he has been sitting in a chair staring at a wall for 15 years. Michael moves in a mechanical fashion, every move Michael makes is done deliberately and efficiently. An injury only temporarily stops Michael, and he is shown to appear and disappear without reason. The original does not give a motive for his killings, giving Michael a kind of mystique. The mask he wears in a white Captain Kirk mask, a neutral face. Michael's victims are forced to die seeing a blank face that is indifferent about killing them. The main character Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) is different from her friends as she is shown to be caring and selfless. Laurie chooses to babysit on Halloween with her friend Annie who drops off the child she herself should have be watching, so that she can go out and have a good time with her boyfriend. Laurie was different though, she watched the child was supposed to and one she did not have to. Laurie even provides some Halloween activities for the kids she babysits. Laurie is a good friend and a good babysitter, so because of these traits in her character, Michael is unable to kill her. Halloween isn't an isolated horror film. It does not take place in a far-off hotel or the middle of the woods, but in a far more relatable setting of a pair of neighborhood houses. Cries for help are ignored by neighbors who do not want to get involved. Halloween makes good use of the dark nighttime setting. Michael appears to dissolve and appear in the shadows. The soundtrack by John Carpenter is a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack. It makes the ordinarily seem ominous and unsettling. The sound is what really makes the movie scary and sets the tone. The film uses certain techniques to hide Michael. Most of time Michael is just a shape in the background, just watching. The opening is a seamless sequence of Michael's P.O.V as he enters the house and kills his sister. This opening leaves the impression that anyone is capable of murder, especially a young child.The movie ends with Loomis preventing the death of Laurie Strode by shooting Michael out of a 2nd story window. When Loomis goes to check the body, it is revealed that Michael has disappeared. The closing statement is that evil never dies and that it is out there and can be anywhere. Highly Recommended10/10"", ""Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.This film may seem clichÃ© today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers."", ""*****SPOILER FREE***** I'll lay the cards on the table, and say this is perhaps the greatest horror film of all time. When asked the question 'what movie would you like to see on the big screen? The answer will resoundingly always be Halloween.Halloween manages to have you on the edge of your seat, poised to cover your eyes with a blanket. Michael Myers, the mask, the music, Jamie Lee Curtis as the perfect victim, the list is endless, so many elements combine to make it the greatest horror of all time.I had nightmares as a child, peering through a gap in the door as my parents watched it, the bed sheet/ghost scene is as harrowing now as it was back then.>>>>>as Halloween approaches order the popcorn, shut the blinds and put this movie on>>>>>"", ""I know everyone is gonna disagree with me when I say all this. I understand this was the first slasher film, it influenced almost every slasher film today (which we really could have done with out!) Just because something is the first of it's kind doesn't make it good. There's no mystery in this film, no creepy or scary bits, nothing interesting in it at all! Michael Myers doesn't even have a reason for killing people! I also don't get why he is such a superhuman and just disappears and dies and comes back to life all the time. He just a person! The actors... what can I say. Awful! Cheesy and not convincing. Especially those kids. I would have expected more from a so called 'classic'. The one thing I liked in this film is the theme tune. And even that gets annoying! Usually I would recommend a slasher film just to get scared and to watch on Halloween not to be interested or get into the story. Halloween doesn't a interesting plot and is not scary. There is no way this film should be a classic. Most overrated film of all time. 2/10"", ""I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. Shows you what an awful reviewer Roger Ebert is that he gave it four stars."", ""John Carpenter's HalloweenIs it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. The film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. It's unfortunate I didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release, but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then. My father suggested before I go see Halloween H20 that I whip out and rent Halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching Halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the Slasher Genre.The film's plot is simple, In 1963 Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. Incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls: Laurie Strode an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett a tough talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here where he enlists the help of the town Sheriff Leigh Brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one, until only sweet innocent Laurie is left who is the prime target on Michael's list.The casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle who portrays Michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walk and body movements were perfect.One of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young Laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her Michael's face materializes before he strikes. Michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most, the white emotionless face worked perfectly.What makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy Friday The 13th films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension. It became so clear that Halloween spawned movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he is a mere rip off of Michael Myers.To sum it up, I suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time."", ""This movie is only a classic in the way that a DeLorean is a classic, that is that they are both old and have a strong cult following in spite of their many many flaws. I've never found Jamie Lee Curtis to be a particularly skilled actor, but in this , she is so terrible its almost laughable, but really with her father being Tony Curtis and all of the resources and acting classes that should have provided her its really more sad than anything. Classic ? really its more the prototype for the clichÃ© bad horror movie.Not scary, banal, not worth watching again or in the first place if you haven't seen it, unless you simply must just to say that you have.""]",/posters/xHalloweenÂ (1978).jpg
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2Â (2017) ,(2017),7.7,2h 16min,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']",PG-13,The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.,James Gunn,James Gunn,"['Chris Pratt,', 'Zoe Saldana,', 'Dave Bautista']","[""I have to start by saying the first film was my favourite film of the last few years and I'm a huge fan.But let's be honest, this was a huuuge let down of a sequel after an amazing first film. The first had a good story, fleshed out characters, believable villains, genuine affection, drama, tension and a soundtrack that was original and used brilliantly.This film had a weak, bloated story. Almost every scene filled with forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.This was was like a comedy parody of the first film. A goofy, TV sequel that had none of the magic of the original blockbuster.At one point Drax wisecracks that he does big turds. I'd venture none as big as this one.Avoid"", 'With so much talent in this film, it\'s so disappointing that the writers were right . Don\'t waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.On the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I\'ve seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn\'t be honest if I didn\'t give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I\'d have to say that I\'ve about had enough with this series. We\'ve heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it\'s clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. Without giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I\'ll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:(1) Repeated jokes as if we\'re supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.(4) The explanation of the villain\'s plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It\'s one thing to have a ""special moment"" and another to believe we\'re too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)', ""My main criticism was that I don't feel like you needed to have seen the previous movie to really get/enjoy this one. You would have missed out on the bonding of the team and the backstory of Nebula and Gamora, but overall you'd be fine. Overall, though it was a great movie, it felt more like a side story in the many adventures of the Guardians of the Galaxy and less like an actual continuation of their main story. Why? Well, we did have that wonderful cameo of great actors who portrayed the original Guardians. We had our Stan Lee cameo. And, we had Peter Quill's backstory explained. Other then that, I don't yet see how any of this advanced the main plot of Thanos or of any big threat to the Galaxy. My favorite parts of the movie were Rocket and Yondu's character growth. I felt tears in my eyes when Yondu died. Such a powerful message that parentage and parents can be such distinct things. Also, Gamora and Nebula's sister bonding and reconciliation. Their scenes were so much of what it is to be a sister. One cannot hate in such a way without there being love in the mix.The only truly plot advancing potential that I saw in this movie were the after-credit scenes. Especially the one with Adam. Only time will tell if any more of this will have an effect on the Marvel Universe. Regardless, this was a great story to tell."", ""As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say."", ""This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior. I also loved the opening scene which I think was very cool.In addition to the good chemistry among the stars, I also felt that Mantis' character was fun to see, especially whenever she was interacting with Drax. In this sequel, it was also surprising to see Drax' very funny characterization and his comments. Both Yondu and Nebula also had larger important role in this movie compared to Volume 1. There was even a surprise new character played by Sylvester Stallone whom I understand would be having larger role in future Marvel movies.Apart from those fun interactions and the nice light story, the movie itself was not the type of full of action scenes. Mostly it was done in the early stage, middle part and the ending part. The sound effects were good, the effects involving Baby Groot and Rocket were awesome, but I felt the CGI effects were not that nice, especially during the scenes in the Ego planet where it really looked computerized. However, it was not really a bothering scene. One thing that was quite curious for me is the trailer to this movie was already showing Kurt Russel portraying Peter's father, which I thought would be best kept hidden to avoid spoiler. But then as we continued watching it, I realized that it was more like a part that was supposed to intrigue us.I personally felt that this movie was better than Volume 1, in term of the story and characterizations. And for those of you who knew that Marvel's movies would have some end credit scenes, better wait till the very end, since this film had got not 1, not 2 not even 3, but 5 post credit scenes altogether.So if you enjoyed the first volume, you would enjoy this one even better. I would recommend you to watch the first one before seeing this one to have a better understanding on the movie. Though I am pretty sure that most likely you would have seen it. Now if you are a fan of a much heavier superhero movie, than this one may not suit your thirst, but I am confident that you would still be entertained watching this one."", 'At the time of writing, there are only 7 out of 120 user reviewers that did not like the movie. I know I will receive a multitude of unhelpful votes for voicing my honest feedback about this movie. However, I hope that my feedback will be helpful for people who are able to judge a film in an objective manner so that they, at least, will be able to save their hard earned cash.Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of ""Fast and Furious"". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone\'s performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).With the exception of Captain America and the first two Avengers and Thor movies, why do the Marvel movies have to be over-saturated with humor? It\'s one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it\'s totally another thing when it\'s taken too far, and the humor becomes so clichÃ©d.', ""***Potential Spoilers***+Visuals were okay but not that great at some point it kinda looked animated +Acting was perfect -but the plot was Horrible -Some of the comedy sequences felt Forced-Villian was underwhelming -Overacting -Pacing issuesMarvel overused their formula in this one & it just felt Choppy & bloated there are jokes but by jokes i mean there are too many if you are fan of Forced ripoff jokes then this movie is for you there wasn't even much action You have a guy name Drax the Destroyer but you given him only one Action sequence Come'on **Spoilers* Nebula tries to kills herself to kill Gamora, and later on both of them forgive each other ? It just felt messy The only thing i learned from GOTG 2 is that never go with high expectation while seeing a movie"", ""OMG, what a terrible sequel to one of the best movies of the decade...Shallow, unfunny, clichÃ©d, predictable and often pathetic, in many places poorly acted and directed, with overabundance of cheesy fake-looking rainbow effects.It's like writers read all viewer comments to Vol.1 then added whatever people liked 100 times over into Vol.2. So the lovely 80s music vignette now becomes massive bore shoveled into every scene, complex Yondu-Peter relationship gets butchered into cheesy pathos, Yondu's character gets reduced to repeating Vol.1 whistling scene over and over, Rocket goes boring with highlights being Vol.1 repeats, Gamora/Nebula relation - again repeats, Groot no development at all beyond Vol.1 ending cute cgi.The only character that actually gets improved is Drax, his lines are written and get delivered in the best manner of the first movie, unfortunately that can't keep this wreck afloat."", ""This story has a philosophically intriguing and imaginative theme. If a person lived forever and for millions of years, what would be his psychology. What if he is also able to manifest his physical body and his world through his thoughts. This movie presents a picture where this person becomes extremely egoistic. There is no 'she' to this 'him' and I think that's what went wrong with this guy.He creates a wonderful planet and then to get rid of his loneliness goes around looking for other life in the universe. He finds many women, makes love to them and plants his seed on every planet he went so that he could take over the universe. He is able to destroy other beings and planets. This makes him think he could just destroy them whenever he wanted and walk away from the crime scene. But his son proves him wrong.Although it is nowhere close, this story does remind of god the father and Jesus the son and another story where it all went biblical. So the son in the story realizes who is father is, and who his real daddy is, and the difference between the two.Another interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between two sisters. Gamora and Nebula who were brought up by an abusive parent. Gamora remained beautiful because of her sister's sacrifices. I like the part where Gamora realizes this fact and starts appreciating her sister. Nebula was at the verge of killing her sister because she felt she had had enough. Love renders us weak and sacrifice has its limits. But in the end honest communication works its magic. The importance of role of communication in personal relationships comes to forefront altogether.There are many other intriguing things like Yondu looking into Rocket's eyes and saying a magical phrase. Totally amazing movie. A must watch."", ""The intro was one of the best I've seen in a movie for a long time, Mixture of Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Skies while the rest fight in the background is pure mind blowing Joy. So many LOL moments, the cinema crowd were in stitches, I have to go see this again, I won't meander on too long but this for me was on par and up there for the first movie. That's tough thing to pull off these days as the firstwas mind blowing as I don't think anyone expected it to be so good again I was expecting this to be great but not as good but I was wrong. Part of me was hoping for another tentative link towards Infinity Wars but a minor niggle on my part. Great Movie Great Characters Great Laughs"", 'I watched the first movie I believe at least 50 times, one of my favourite movie since the last 10 years; however this Vol. 2 really disappointed me. I think it\'s a goofy movie for kids, a bit different from the first one. The ""funny"" scenes have been dramatized too much, so much that they became stupid jokes. The movie itself is too long, no funny movie should ever be so long. You cannot keep people laughing for more than 2 hours...even if the movie was a REALLY funny movie (which it was not). I was expecting coming out this Vol. 2 for so long...I guess I created too many expectations for it. Go to watch the movie thinking that would be ""just OK"", my 2 cents.', ""Where do I even begin? Oh my... this script could have easily been written by a 10-year-old, practically every move and line of dialogue were predictable, clichÃ©d, and downright cringy most of the time. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this 'movie' gets any form of praise for the 'acting' that took place in this movie. The aforementioned acting was weak, not only did the story lack substance, but practically every interaction is inevitably guided towards infantile, unintelligent humor. The CGI/Animation were not up to the standard that we are accustomed to from Marvel, it was just flashy and all over the place. I usually try not to write any negative reviews, but this was just too much to handle. I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was in awe as to how awful this movie was. Marvel movies have silly humor here and there but a good portion of the jokes are well placed in their movies, they can even be intelligent and memorable; but this... whatever this was... horrendous writing. If you are like me, and want to be up-to-date with what's happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's why you chose to watch this movie, you didn't miss out on anything."", ""It's not often you wanted to hear side B of a tape. Unless you were too lazy to rewind it. I'm not sure how they did it but side B aka Vol. 2 is a greatest hits album. It went double Vibranuim. The cast stays in complete character only improving by letting the audience get to know and love them. Even Drax's absurd laugh was necessary. They did not drag you through the beef between sisters, x gang affiliates or father and son. They only produced an appropriate outcome for each situation that leaves the studio wide open for Vol. 3. The soundtrack is really its own character making even the most rhythmically challenged viewers feeling comfortable bobbing their heads. I don't watch trailers so hearing a familiar voice in a film that already had it all was the bonus track with features artist."", 'What\'s Hollywood\'s obsession with family these days? Wonder if it has to do the the growing culture of nepotism elsewhere. Regardless, a script cannot rely on simply yelling ""FAMILY"" as the motivation for EVERYTHING. And this movie works that clichÃ© to DEATH. *LITERALLY*Not worth a 1/10, more like a 6 plus (which I\'ll adjust when they stop manipulating the ratings. Forgettable at best, and you know the story is crap when all you can remember is CGI baby Groot. Suffers terribly from Bond villain syndrome, in that villains needs too much exposition (AKA weird and unexplained motivations).Actual line in the movie, after one character tries to murder another, ""You needed to win, I just wanted a *RELATIVE*."" *slow claps* that TOTALLY explains attempted murder.

""Guardians 2"" is all about family. ""Vol. 2"" is the movie rarityâthe sequel greater than the original. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" retains its whimsical irreverence and funnier than thou swag with stunning visuals. From the opening sequence the Guardians hilariously thrash and get thrashed by a galactic serpent on some distant planet. Their mission is to recover some invaluable unpronounceable energy batteries for the elitist Sovereign race. Director and Writer James Gunn establishes the veiled narrative thread, and the movie is warp speed ahead.Incredible action and wisecracks aside what creates ""Guardians 2"" as special is family. I was moved and inspired as Chris Pratt\'s Peter confesses, ""Sometimes, the thing you\'ve been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along."" From the first ""Guardians"" we recall the deadly rivalry of the sisters Gamora, played by strong nurturing Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by suffering and poignant Karen Gillan. After fighting nearly to the death, Nebula cries to her sister, ""You\'re the one who wanted to win! I wanted a sister!"" Saldana and Gillan are amazing. ""Guardians 2"" fiercely dares to touch your heart.Chris Pratt impressively chiseled his body to play Peter Quill. He admirably helms the action star mantle. He makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" greater as a whole. He does charming smart ass whether he is clumsily romancing beautiful Saldana\'s Gamora or delivering throwaway on-liners. Pratt\'s humanity distinguishes him as a true star. Peter discovers his father Ego, played by charismatic Kurt Russell. Ego is the Celestial-- literally a god, who left Peter\'s dying Mother. Peter asks his Father if she was the love of his life, why he left her. Peter says, ""I had to watch her die!"" Michael Rooker\'s Ravager thief Yondu was the one who raised Peter in Ego\'s absence. All is not what it seems. Rooker\'s nobility and compassion resonates the profound conflict of Peter\'s Fathers. Ego tells Peter that he loves him, having finally found him after all these years. He wants to share his legacy and power with his son. James Gunn brilliantly orchestrates the interstellar action, wisecracks, and tragedy. He fearlessly evokes his version of Shakespeare in this comic book tale. ""Guardians 2"" is wildly entertaining with the great soul. Hysterical mercenary Rocket, the cybernetic raccoon voiced by sarcastic Bradley Cooper, steals some of the Sovereign batteries as lovely parting gifts from the arrogant golden skinned jerks. Humorless Queen Ayesha, played by wonderfully zealous Elizabeth Debicki, sends her \'gamer\' operated space fleet upon the Guardians in retaliation. Fortunately, Ego and his companion Mantis, played by whimsical beauty Pom Klementieff, save our heroes from destruction. Ego tells Peter that he is his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax, played by brutishly funny Dave Bautista, agree to accompany his Father to his home planet Egoâthe planet he created. The visual images of Ego are idyllic and serene. Russell\'s Ego is both omnipotent and the great enigma. Mantis is the gifted empath, who helps him sleep and protects his secrets. Ego welcomes his son home, revealing his destiny. Ego doesn\'t necessarily add up. Is this what Peter wished for?Director Gunn\'s ""Guardians 2"" invents the narrative spectrum of David Hasselhoff jokes, cool retro \'70s rock, kick ass martial arts, galactic ship battles, and quirky charming relationships. With Gunn\'s direction all his stars give their best. Bautista\'s hulking tatted blue warrior Drax is crude, brave, and soulful. Klementieff\'s Mantis is mesmerizing charm. She is genuinely kind, crushing on Big Drax. Saldana is awesome. She has a commanding and calming screen presence. Gunn could have leveraged more romance in Gamora and Peter\'s love story. Throughout Pratt and Saldana generate authentic chemistry. The narrative focus is on Peter\'s bond with his fathers, and Gamora\'s reconcile with estranged sister Nebula. Saldana is radiant and noble with Gillan\'s surprising Nebula. Gillan\'s humanity emerges as we empathize for her desire to be loved. I think ""Guardians 2"" becomes the story of the Fathers and their son âof love and destiny. All is not what it appears. Russell and Rooker are eloquently polarizing forces. Pratt embodies courage and fearless vulnerability as Peter boldly defines the man he wants to be. ""Guardians 2"" is touchingly, tearfully about unconditional love and choice. Considering the grand design of the movie that is the wondrous surprise. Simple and sweet. I loved ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"".', 'Best movie just like the first one..makes me wanna watch it again and never get bored cause all the cast is super amazing with their character in this film...!!

While the events may have been true we certainly do not know for a fact how it really went down. I know for a lot of people from the other side of the pond, anything that their govt and army says is the gospel. However I am really weary of seeing Captain America type of movies where only the Americans know how to shoot, kill, jump, ride and have emotions. Did I fail to mention are invincible as well. On that accord this movie excelled. The Afghans who incidentally historically have fought and mind you defeated many empires were once again portrayed and fumbling buffoons. If you wish to see how great and good the Americans are you will also not be disappointed.', ""I was very disappointed, when I left the cinema. It's all 'good guy, bad guy'; The Americans are the saints, the heros; The Al Qaida the bastards.A soldier is asked; 'Will you do this dangerous job?' Fearless he answers: 'We're here anyway. Let's finish the job'. Yawns...I'm more into realistic war-movies, with depth-characters. So to me, watching this movie was a waste of my time (and money)."", ""It's hard for me to believe that this movie is based upon the real events because US and coalition have been in Afghanistan for 16.5 years and still it's getting worst, if their 12 men can do this then why they have stationed 30000+ troops and got 4000+ killed or maybe movie makers were little extra motivated to make it a more dabang kind of action war movie"", '""Depth"":\n This film was incredibly satisfying to me. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat when I was watching it. I really hate seeing these reviews that are complaining about the movie\'s depth, and I can see why you would consider that one of the film\'s flaws...but giving it a 5/10 or less because of that one flaw...really? If you think that there are more flaws than that then I would understand...but there\'s more to a film than it\'s ""depth"", especially a film based on a true story. I honestly thought this movie was very meaningful and thoughtful of the people that actually fought after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It seems that critics aren\'t thinking about that at all, they just care about this one flaw in the film. You know that people don\'t look into a film as much as they need to when they give a film a pretty low rating because they noticed one flaw, especially one that a lot of people wouldn\'t notice, and or care about. My Thoughts On The Movie:\n This movie really showed me what the fights after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were like...and that\'s pretty much the movie\'s entire goal, is to educate it\'s viewers on what happened after 9/11. It was also a very heartwarming movie. Seeing all of the character\'s saying goodbye to their families was pretty sad to watch, but then you see characters like Mitch Nelson (played by Chris Hemsworth) smiling when they come back home seeing their families joyful reactions, you feel your heart sitting next to a fire (well...unless you care WAY too much about the films depth...). And that is what makes this a good ""War"" movie, that it\'s not just violence, it also explores the lives of the characters that are fighting in it. Seeing all of the main protagonists bond and joke with each other could also be really satisfying to people who don\'t like the ""overly-serious"" type films (I, however, am not one of those people). I just like how the writers put some humor into their script for this movie, and that\'s something you have to appreciate for films like this. If you\'re into these kinds of movies, I definitely suggest you watch it, and if you don\'t know, give it a watch, and if you\'re not, then you probably shouldn\'t watch it. Just focus on the movie\'s storyline and not on ENTIRELY on the depth, this movie has a lot of meaning to it and it\'s not aiming to become a perfect movie (not many films do), it just wants to educate it\'s viewers, which is what a lot of ""History"" films do, try to educate the viewer.

The story was typically set up with the film showing the soldiers family lives and the difficult situation of leaving to serve their country and it flowed on from there. I felt there wasn't the typical Hollywood style soldier being portrayed here, which was a good thing. The one aspect of the film that stood out for me were the battle scenes which were really well staged. One small criticism was the Taliban and their role in the movie, I wanted to see more of a backstory to show how brutal they actually are. The character development was pretty good and the dialogue wasn't that of a Tarantino or McDonagh film, there wasn't a lot the actors could delve into to show how good they are, especially Michael Shannon who I really enjoy seeing.

I felt the cast was excellent, and battle scenes realistic.\nGo see this movie, I'm glad that stories like this get told!"", ""Yes, Thor wins the battle but has lost the war ever since. Chris Hemsworth plays a stalwart, heroic Captain Mitch Nelson in the docudramaed engagement by Special Forces in Afghanistan after 9/11. On horseback, much less. The movie is called 12 Strong and 12 American soldiers did succeed in beating back an Al Qaeda warlord. Not one American soldier was lost.This feat, through a pass that would be considered Thermopylae at any time, was successful because of the cooperation of Afghan warlord General Dostum (David Negahbon), a joint venture that surely must have set the model for our endless and fruitless attempts to bring justice to that rogue country. No country has achieved success in over 2000 years, a testimony to the difficult warfare well described in this film.\nBeyond the rocks and hills are no memorable lines (ironic because the writers penned superb Silence of the Lambs and The Town) and no twists of fate. 12 Strong just trudges forward to a mountain pass that promises death except for the dashing captain's Lawrence-like rush to save the day. In other words, this is another B war movie with not even 1940's stirring wisecracks or satisfactory twists. I should note that hints of writing greatness occur when the captain and the warlord engage each other in philosophical repartee. Too little.The obligatory goodbyes to family and children are there at the beginning and at the hellos in the conclusion. This formulaic stuff does not a great film make.That's all folks except the waste of Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Hal Spencer. While Hemsworth can never seriously be wasted because of his heroic mien and film provenance, Shannon is too good an actor to be given such a lean role.If you want to make some sense of the Byzantine world of Mud-eastern battle, then see 12 Strong. If you want solid filmmaking, re-see Saving Private Ryan."", ""Great story, but the movie was not riveting the way it could have been.But man, Chris Hemsworth could read the phone book and it would be visually appealing.Unbelievable story and next time I'm in NYC I'll look for the horse statue."", 'Pros \nStrong performance from Chris Hemsworth.Really interesting story with exciting actions scenesCons \nLacks character developmentFilm relied to heavily on Hemsworth and that took away from the scope of the battles Uninteresting first act Film does nothing to separate from other war films, pushes no bounders', 'To sum it up, its boring Hollywood propaganda.

Highly recommend this movie"", ""Look, it is a bit uneven but the other reviewers really do hit the corners with this movie. You can lose yourself in it for a few hours and just have a laugh here and there. David Oleyowo is talented. Here he bends his acting style to being poop on the highway of life, a man who decides he is not going to take it anymore. He does not Rambo it out; he figures out what he must do. He is a gentleman turned pragmatist. Sure the movie could be smoothed out a bit but give it a break; it's funny. Oleyowo can really be funny.

Unfortunately all the funniest clips were in there trailer, therefore I hardly laughed since I\'d already seen all the best jokes. It gets better towards the end, almost everyone dies, and Harold gets a new identity, moves, opens ""Harry\'s Bar"". Film finishes at that point.I can\'t really recommend this shambles of a film.', ""'Gringo (2018)' is an uneven and unsure piece, one that stumbles over its tone and pacing more times than you can count and yet manages to pick itself off the ground on pretty much every such occasion. Its massively slow start paves the way for an, at times, incredibly exciting but then strangely dull adventure with peaks and valleys of the highest and lowest proportions. It continuously cuts back to an all-star cast who sadly drain the life of the film as, though they are all brilliant, they each play narcissistic sociopaths who aren't nearly as radiant or interesting as David Oyelowo's eponymous hero - who is played to perfection and is earnestly enjoyable on many levels. The overall effect of the flick is an enjoyable but forgettable one, a sense that a better - if slightly more traditional - story resides somewhere inside this mess. It's not bad, but it's not great either. 6/10"", ""I was having a chat with a friend earlier about how many of the Hollywood movies seem to be reboots, remakes, and sequels, though one of the main reasons for this is that movies tend to be high risk endeavours costing at times hundreds of millions of dollars that actually trying something new is simply not worth it. I guess this is why some of the really original films actually end up being at the low end of the market, and it appears that this film certainly falls into that category. While the film itself isn't strictly original, there are elements of it that certainly set it apart from a lot of the other films that we see around the place.\n Basically it is about this middle manager who got his job simply because he was friends with one of the bosses. However, he is a nice guy, and the reality of the business world is that nice guys end up getting shafted. Well, he ends up in Mexico sorting out some business with a plant down there, and upon discovering what is really going on decides that he might try extorting some money out of the company, and the fact that his wife had just left him, there really isn't all that much left for him back in the states.\n This is one of those films that introduces us to multiple disparate characters who all eventually come together - well not quite, but there is a connection there. One of them is a guy that has been persuaded to go to Mexico and bring back some pills for analysis. However, there is also a Mexican drug lord that has been profiting off of the company's underhanded dealings, and when he discovers that he has also been cut off, decides that he wants to take what he believes to be rightfully his.\n I guess in the end it is the characters that really make this film, and that can actually work well - create the characters and build the film around them. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but then again if you have a well rounded character that will react in certain ways in certain situations then you are on the way to actually creating a half decent story. Okay, I won't necessarily say that this is one of the best films out there, but it certainly has its perks, and the characters really did stand out at times - particularly the protagonist Harold. Having a Nigerian accent also added to that authenticity.\n There is one thing about this film that stands out, and that is loyalty, or rather the lack of it. I noticed that out of all the characters in the film there were only two that could be considered honest and loyal - pretty much everybody else was completely untrustworthy. The question that is raised though really comes down to whether it is worth it. Well, it was a bit of a hit or miss in this film - not all of the dishonourable people got it, and not all of the decent people got away clean. Sure, a number of the nasty characters did get it in the neck, but a few of them managed to get away. I guess this is another other of this nice things about the film because while a number of these characters ended up meeting a rather sorry end, not all of them did."", 'Sophomore director Nash Egerton\'s unsavory, amoral, comedy of errors ""Gringo"" qualifies as contrived, convoluted, and ultimately incoherent. This nice-guys-finish-first comedy pits a clueless hero against his unscrupulous superiors at a pharmaceutical firm that plans to corner the American market with a marijuana pill. Were this not enough, our gullible hero must also dodge a trigger-happy Mexican cartel boss with a fondness for the Beatles! A midlevel executive at a Chicago pharmaceutical firm, Nigerian immigrant Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo of ""Selma"") finds himself caught in the crossfire between his own pharmaceutical company that wants him dead as well as a homicidal cartel which wants him alive. Our hero\'s superiors are two treacherous co-executives who don\'t trust each other. They decide to liquidate Harold while they orchestrate a merger with another pill company. Somewhere in ""Gringo"" lurked a provocative comedy about pharmaceutical skullduggery, but director Nash Egerton and his scenarists muddle the melodramatics with too many subplots and too many characters. The gratuitous violence and the number of gunmen getting slaughtered serve as a dire substitute for humor. The uneven Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone screenplay jumbles the chain of events so the action starts in the middle and then flashes back to the beginning. The primary villains, Richard Rusk (Joel Edgerton of ""Warrior"") and Elaine Markinson (Charlize Theron of ""Atomic Blonde""), own a company named Promethium that has been manufacturing a pill called Cannabax. They argue that once pot becomes legal all over America, Cannabax will swamp the market like Viagra. Not only do Rusk and Elaine feed our hero Harold to the wolves for the sake of profit, but they also infuriate a cartel which had been their partner in Mexico. An eccentric gallery of goofballs, these nitwits fight among themselves, while Harold struggles to survive. All Mexicans are stereotyped as dishonest, untrustworthy scoundrels with no qualms about murder. Since everybody is prepared to betray each other, few of the surprises that Egerton and his scribes pile into this potboiler are revelatory. Out of all the many surprises and reversals, only one pays off. \nHarold Soyinka has known Richard Rusk since they attended college. Rusk considers Harold a bosom buddy. Not only did Rusk hire him at Promethium as a midlevel executive, but he also hired Harold\'s wife, Bonnie (Thandie Newton of ""Good Deeds""), as his interior designer! Repeatedly, Rusk has assured Harold that our hero need not fret about his future. Unfortunately, Harold doesn\'t know that Bonnie has been sleeping with Rusk. Harold\'s friend and accountant, Stu (Bashir Salahuddin of ""Snatched""), suggests that Harold intervene in Bonnie\'s interior design business before she bankrupts him. Eventually, Harold is shocked to learn that Bonnie\'s debts have him poised on the abyss of bankruptcy! Ironically, Harold has spent his entire life being honest. Tragically, he realizes everybody has been taking advantage of him! Making matters even worse, Stu warns Harold he may soon be unemployed, because Rusk and Elaine are plotting a merger. Indeed, everybody else at Promethium uses Stu as their accountant. Harold asks Rusk about the merger, but Rusk lies to Harold that all will be okay. Meantime, Rusk informs Harold that Elaine and he will accompany him to Mexico on his next regular visit to the Cannabax plant, so they can resolve an inventory problem. Naturally, Harold knows nothing about a cartel connection. Foolishly, Rusk and Elaine plan to kaput their partnership with notorious cartel honcho, Juan Miguel Villegas (Carlos Corona of ""Cantinflas""), whose nickname is ""Black Panther."" Moreover, they want to dispose of Harold. Sensing his impending betrayal, Harold pays two low-life motel owners to pose as kidnappers and abduct him. He plans to share with them the ransom that Rusk will pay. Meantime, Villegas\' henchmen scour everywhere for Harold because Harold is the only one who can open the Cannabax plant safe and hand over the formula to Villegas.  \nInitially, Richard decides to save Harold from the kidnappers. He contacts a mercenary, Mitch (Sharlto Copley of ""Chappie""), who happens to be his estranged brother. Actually, Mitch is a hitman trying to atone for his dark past. Meaning, he has no stomach for killing. No sooner has Mitch rescued Harold than he discovers that Harold had staged his own kidnapping! Harold, however, doesn\'t trust Mitch, and he flees from him. Meantime, Rusk discovers a clause in the company\'s corporate life insurance policy that awards $5-million dollars to Promethium if an employee is killed on foreign soil. Now, Rusk wants Mitch to slay Harold rather than save him. Harold manages to elude not only Mitch, but also the cartel because he has a guardian angel who has been watching over him. Were this not convoluted enough, Rusk\'s jealous partner Elaine blows the whistle on him to keep from going to jail as a conspirator. A frivolous subplot about a creepy guitar salesman, Miles (Harry Treadaway of ""City of Ember""), who drags his oblivious girlfriend, Sunny (Amanda Seyfried of ""Mean Girls""), to Mexico so he can steal some Cannabax pills for a Los Angeles drug designer to duplicate the formula complicates matters. These two characters spot Harold on a highway after he escapes from the cartel, but they add little depth to the plot. Amanda Seyfried is squandered in a minor supporting role, but Thandie Newton fares even worse in a cameo as Harold\'s adulterous wife.  \n""Gringo"" resembles a puzzle missing important pieces. You need a score card to keep track of all the characters. The logic of the premise seems flawed, too. Why would Rusk and Elaine keep the Cannabax formula locked up in a safe in faraway Mexico? Why would they want to liquidate Harold when only his thumb print can open that safe? Just because a movie has dozens of buffoons swarming around in crazy circles doesn\'t make it hilarious, no matter how prestigious its cast. Despite its polished production values and stellar cast, ""Gringo"" amounts to a bust.', ""A good friend told me to go watch this film. He told it was a great, fun movie.\nI trusted him and went.\nI've lost a friend..."", 'Not a cheesy comedy due to award winning Sir David oleyowa ( famed MI6 actor) Intriging and surprice ending. Charlise Theron was beautiful and funny as usual and added lots of entertainment. Good acting by Black Panther cartel boss. overall I laughed and giggled a lot.', ""I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

I don't think \nanyone has the right to tell anybody on here not to watch a movie \nas we all have different tastes, but I certainly had fun watching this\nOne."", ""Gringo - Almost painfully average and all over the place, with a few highlights, Charlize Theron's character being the biggest one. It's also too long for a comedy that has very basic plot!"", ""Greetings again from the darkness. In a perfect cinematic world, great acting elevates a terrific script. However, the best case scenario for a weak script, or in this case a messy one, is that it can be offset by acting. Fortunately for director Nash Edgerton (it's been 10 years since his underappreciated THE SQUARE), he has assembled such a quality cast that what amounts to little more than organized chaos is mostly watchable - even if it's not consistently entertaining.The cast is loaded with international talent from Australia, England, South Africa and Latin America. David Oyelowo, far removed from his Martin Luther King role in SELMA, stars as Harold/Harry, a Nigerian immigrant just trying to do his job and live his life according the morals and work ethic instilled by his father. Harold is the trusting type who believes that his free-spending wife is faithful and that his boss is his friend. That boss is Richard Rusk (we should call him Dick) played by Joel Edgerton (the director's brother), and together with Charlize Theron as his Executive VP Elaine, combine to exemplify modern day douche-baggery. The story revolves around the formula for a medicinal marijuana pill that their company is making, and the secretive proposed merger being ironed out. To clean up the books for the audit, Richard and Elaine travel to Mexico to convince their supplier to stop the illicit sales to a local drug lord. They bring the unaware Harold along for his contacts. The turmoil that follows includes a faked kidnapping and staged ransom phone call, two local hotelier brothers scheming for a big take, an American tourist couple with conflicting reasons for their trip, DEA involvement, a grown-up tantrum, an un-retired mercenary on a mission, and an ongoing argument over the best Beatles' album. And you wonder why I described it as messy?Of course, rarely if ever does staging one's own kidnapping go well, so we know Oyelowo's Harold is in for a rough and tumble ride. Multiple car chases turn into multiple car crashes, guns are fired, tequila is consumed, and backs are stabbed - in the proverbial sense. Oyelowo seems to be enjoying his trip outside of movie drama, and Edgerton and Theron do their best to create savage jerks. Sadly, Ms. Theron's character sets the women's movement back a few years with her sexual boardroom viper approach. On top of that are the stream of fat and ethnic jokes that would make Archie Bunker cringe.Co-writers Matthew Stone (muck like BIG TROUBLE, MAN OF THE HOUSE) and Anthony Tambakis (the compelling WARRIOR) are responsible for delivering a script that tries so hard to be too many things: action, comedy, satire, white collar crime, and an expose of greed and lack of integrity. The deep cast also includes Thandie Newton (as Harold's wife), Melonie Diaz (as Rusk's receptionist), Amanda Seyfried as the aptly named Sunny and Harry Treadaway as her misguided boyfriend, Diego Catano and Rodrigo Corea as the brothers running the motel, Yul Vasquez as Angel, Alan Ruck as the schmuck who falls for Elaine's wiles, Carlos Corona as the drug lord Black Panther (talk about bad timing!), Michael's daughter Paris Jackson in her film debut, and a standout as always, Sharlto Copley as the brother-mercenary-humanitarian. As is often said, it's better to be good at one thing, and though this one brings a few laughs and some creative moments, it's mostly an overblown mess that aims to high - or at too many targets."", 'Weak storyline, poorly produced, and big pile of w***', ""While you sort of know how it's going to work out it's a fun ride to see how you get there. Charlize was amazing. Entertaining and fun! I think a lot of the reviewers here while they know movies, don't have a very good sense of humor."", 'In my very amateur opinion the ""professional"" reviews I\'ve read saying this movie has no point or subtext the reviewers are clearly not in possession of the ability to read between the lines. This is a satire pointing out the very real issues of how crooked wealthy, predominately white, capitalists in the U.S. use other countries to produce their drugs, take advantage of socio-economically disadvantaged folks to move their product and the use of predominately African American ""middle managers"" in the states to take the fall for them, both with the law and the various illegal entities all while they sit in their penthouses and profit. I could go more in depth but I don\'t want to spoil the twists. If you are able to pay attention, not have your movie handed to you, and enjoy progressive messages about the ways the capitalist system allows for exploitation of labor as well as commentary on racism. This movie is for you.', ""I'm not sure why this movie didn't do better in theaters but it was actually quite good! Joel Edgerton is one of my favorite actors, he always plays roles that pull and stretch his acting ability. He can be a charming love, a psychopath or a complete asshole. Charlize Theron's character is unbearable yet irresistible. She is domineering and willing to do anything she can to win. Even though she says outrageously prejudice things it's refreshing to see someone honest enough to be themselves no matter how terrible that might be. I love seeing women in roles opposite of the damsel. This film speaks volumes about the views of America through an immigrants eyes. It is funny, sad and entertaining from start to finish! Hope this covers it without giving away the good things !"", 'This movie has some good scenes. But it is definitely not good. \nDavid Oleyowo shows that he can also be pretty funny but this only has a few comedic scenes on it. Amanda SeyfriedÂ´s acting was pretty good as always but I think her character along with her boyfriend were not relevant for this film. Theron and Edgerton were good also. \nAs usual, Hollywood movies show people from other countries (in this case, mexicans and the main character playing a nigerian) as poor, ignorant, criminals, unsuccessful, etc. If you get to know Mexico a little bit better, youÂ´d be surprised that many mexicans are caucasian with blue or green eyes and millionaires or very successful. Some of the richest men in the world are mexican such as the owner of a well known mexican telephone company.\nAlso, you can nottice how some Â¨mexicansÂ¨ speak with a Puerto Rican accent like Yul Vazquez (SeinfeldÂ´s gay Bob) and the airline clerk.\nDefinitely the movie trailer was way better than the film.

The Disaster ArtistÂ (2017) ,(2017),7.5,1h 44min,"['Biography', 'Comedy', 'Drama']",R,"When Greg Sestero, an aspiring film actor, meets the weird and mysterious Tommy Wiseau in an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true.",James Franco,Scott Neustadter,"['James Franco,', 'Dave Franco,', 'Ari Graynor']","[""Ed Wood was Stanley Kubrick compared to Tommy Wiseau but James Franco treats him with such loving care that we can connect with his humanity without letting his eccentricities pull us away from him. That, I think, was the most moving aspect of this outrageous true life tale. James Franco is spectacular keeping it true and real in a character that lent itself for caricature. Dave Franco, James's brother in real life is the most believable instant soulmate of the James Dean wannabe. Seth Rogen is also perfect as the one knows that they're in for a major disaster and yet sees the whole thing to the bitter end. I must confess I hadn't heard of The Room but now it's on top of my list of films I want to see next."", ""There was an odd buzz surrounding this film, that in my opinion was totally unmerited. It just scratches the surface of the story and embellishes some things. I'm someone who is not a fan of The Room because, well it's really bad. That being said I really wanted to see what Franco had to offer here as far as unpacking what the hell caused the debacle of a film. Really Disaster Artist was an empty look and borders on biography and parody. I found the end to be very very overdone and from what I know, entirely fabricated."", ""The idea of this movie is great. it had the potential to be so much. people were genuinely excited about it. it had james franco.\nyet still this movie kind of faltered after an interesting start.\njames franco's performace was a little too on the nose. it becomes really apparent when at the end they play side by side comparison shots. it was a little exagerated and though the physical resemblance was uncanny at times, it came off as trying to hard.\nwhile that's the problem with james, which is understandable because the movie was literally going for an element of comedy, the rest of the cast didn't seem to be invested enough in the film. no one else really resembled the people, physically or in mannerism, they were supposed to be playing. so the whole setting was weird where james was in too much character and no one else in enough. the room is the room mainly because of tommy but not just because of him, and that's the point I think they missed.\ncasting dave franco was also a mistake in my opinion. I think zac efron, who has a cameo btw, should have played his role instead. he just brings that zest, even to a shy under-confident character, that dave failed to do.\nso all in all even though it's enjoyable, the disaster artist failed to TEAR ME APART with it's comedy and drama"", 'I thought for sure ""The Disaster Artist"" would be a slam-dunk based on advance buzz and reviews, and eagerly got out and saw it when it went wide and opened in my hometown this weekend. I enjoyed the heck out of roughly the first third of the film, but then, when it got around to the lengthy section depicting the making of ""The Room,"" the ""best worst film ever made,"" and the supposed mayhem of the actual real-life production crew and cast, I thought it fell flat and became a cartoon riff on what likely actually did happen on the real-life set. For some reason, Seth Rogen, who I normally get a big kick out of (though sometimes his trademark snark wears out its welcome) irritated me, as did other actors laying it on thick with the script\'s ""wink-wink-nudge-nudge"" too-obvious reaction to the mystery of Tommy Wiseau and his approach to life and filmmaking: I\'m sure in real life crew and cast members\' reactions to actually working on the ""The Room"" had a lot more complicated depth to them-- especially since they were being paid well and their checks were clearing at the bank as the production proceeded. Instead, we get this obvious, wafer-thin, surface and stereotypical reaction to Wiseau, with well-known actors doing small parts and winking at the camera as if to say ""isn\'t this funny""--which works for some films but just doesn\'t work here. Thankfully, the ending section of the film, depicting the premiere of ""The Room"" and all that\'s happened since, almost saves it, but it had flagged too much by then for me to feel I got my money\'s (or time\'s) worth. I like the Franco brothers, am truly a fan of their wide variety of mainstream and independent film efforts overall (I\'m one of the few who actually liked ""Why Him?"" and ""This is The End,"" two polarizing comedies that either brought belly laughs or annoyed the heck out people) but ""The Disaster Artist"" is not either of their best efforts. It\'s clearly meant as a star-studded-cameo playtime lark, but a lark that those same actors likely enjoyed more than we do as an audience--and in my opinion it doesn\'t serve the real-life people it depicts very well, either, except to make viewers curious about the real ""The Room"" film, and about the people involved in that production. I was surprised that in the end the Francos and all involved in ""The Disaster Artist"" seemed to be laughing at--and not affectionately with--the real Tommy Wiseau and actors/crew of ""The Room.""', ""The Disaster Artist is absolutely incredible. I don't want to go into detail because honestly this is one of those movies that is best seen relatively blind. What I will say is that the performances are great, the chemistry between Tommy and Greg is pitch perfect, and Seth Rogen and the rest of the supporting cast do an excellent job. The tone of the film is absolutely spot on. The last scene of this movie, and what comes after the end card, absolutely blew me away; this film is so much fun. I just saw this movie, and I already want to see it again. I rarely say this, but I can't think of literally anything this movie could've done differently that would've made it better. Everything it set out to do is done incredibly well. I highly, highly recommend this film. 10/10"", 'The movie is not as fun as just watching the movie The Room. It does have some interesting moments, such as showing how James Dean famously yelled, ""You\'re tearing me apart!"" and now that factored into the backstory behind the film. It shows how Tommy had a strange amount of money and made a really bad movie with it. The film never really gives us any characters to root for, however. They come across as selfishly motivated for fame as opposed to being motivated to use their powers to help other people. This isn\'t really bad - it just means its hard to care for the characters. There is also a moving camera, and it gave me motion sickness.', ""This is actually worse than The Room. The Franco's need a punch in the face."", 'I had fun with the story. Very intriguing. I have not seen the original yet.. but I will search it out now.. The problem with this movie is how it was made, with ALL hand-held camera shots.. The camera is in a constant state of jitter. I mean EVERY SINGLE SCENE.. Even scenes where the two main characters are sitting still and having dialog, the camera is moving.. It is so annoying.. You can even detect the camera operators steps when the scene is moving. Seriously? Has movie making gotten THAT lazy? Do we care that little? This problem coupled with the very short scene cuts leave your eyes in a constant state of adjustment. This extremely short scene cuts is something you would expect on a modern TV show. It almost ruined the entire experience..', ""Absolutely the most self indulgent piece crap I've ever seen."", 'Whoever says this movie is great does not know movies at all. Franco gives the same performance as in all his movies, rather stick to playing characters high, it suits him better.', 'In this film, the Franco brothers show us exactly why we all want to deck their smug grinning faces. This film is all about them smirking at each other while making fun of an absurd/sad film they saw together once. The Room was a preposterous farce, but it had soul. This film has none and while Franco tries his hardest to win awards for mimicry, he fails to convince anyone he is anything but James Franco being a self aggrandising d-bag.', 'Watched ""The Room 2003"" then this back to back. The Room is strangely watchable but watching this was like listening to a drunk uncle trying to remember a joke. Perhaps in 15 years someone will make a movie about how bad this one is. It\'s a pity they cut the scene at the end when Logan Paul found the body, that was the best part.', ""This was absolute piss. James Franco has gone down hill. I've been noticing him in a bunch of films lately that are very ...different... to say the least. I feel that he's becoming and overrated actor. But, this movie was the most idiotic thing. I wanted to rip my hair out with how annoying James was. But I just stopped it instead."", 'Perhaps the hardest thing about judging THE DISASTER ARTIST is how to suss out how much of this odd bio-pic is sincere, and how much of it is James Franco putting on another of his art projects. The story of Tommy Wiseau (played by Franco himself) is intrinsically fascinating. A forty-something immigrant passes himself off as a twenty-something from New Orleans and moves to Hollywood with an actual twenty-something (Greg Sestero, played by Franco\'s real brother Dave). Each aspire to become actors. Together, they make a vanity project which becomes notorious as a \'So Bad It\'s Good\' film classic. I personally drove past that curious Highland Boulevard billboard hundreds of times, shaking my head all the while.DISASTER starts off promisingly. Franco seems earnest in trying to tell Wiseau and Sestero\'s off-beat Hollywood wannabe tale. The brothers Franco use their kinship to give their on screen friendship an extra bit of verisimilitude. As a Director, Franco manages to balance the satirical and the sensitive portrayal of the duo pretty nicely. And, then we get to the making of THE ROOM itself.From there on, DISASTER takes a turn for the worse as the movie shunts aside much of the goodwill towards Wiseau in favor of mockery. Chief among the flaws is Seth Rogan as a fictionalized version of script supervisor Sandy Schklair (the actual Sandy quit during the shoot, and, in a bizarre turn of events actually tried to claim credit for Directing much of THE ROOM). Rogan comes off as a wise-ass who openly mocks Wiseau and the film from the get-go (Schklair has said he has trouble with the portrayal). Rogan\'s version of Sandy becomes a stand-in for all those who attend THE ROOM\'s midnight screening in order to hurl wisecracks at the hapless Wiseau. The fact that Wiseau now claims that his is ""in"" on the joke, doesn\'t make it any less cruel.It\'s unfortunate that Franco lets this aspect take over DISASTER ARTIST. There is much to praise, including Franco\'s own uncanny mimicry of Wiseau\'s seemingly inimitable style (Franco\'s accent does slip a bit during the \'Directing\' scenes). Parts of it seem to genuinely have an affinity for Wiseau and his dreams, and the depiction of the making of a low budget feature has a certain ring of truth to it, despite exaggerations.And, yet... The big premiere scene isn\'t credible (I\'ve been to many a disastrous screening, and, they don\'t spontaneously turn into a Rocky Horror style midnight event; my suspicions backed up by first person accounts of attendees). Why the Bryan Cranston scene was invented is never explained (to get in yet another celebrity cameo?). And, why maintain the illusion of a ""mystery"" surrounding Wiseau\'s origins? He\'s from Poland and he was in his late 40s when THE ROOM was made. Franco\'s brave decision to end the body of the movie with side by side clips of his recreations of scenes from THE ROOM with actual ones is quite meta (as good as they were, I have to say my attention still drifted more to Wiseau\'s originals than to the Franco ones; There\'s still something to be said about authenticity - even if incompetent).A large group of millennials sat in the back row of the screening I attended. They seemed primed to mock Wiseau at every turn. And, on cue, they openly guffawed at every poorly pronounced word out of Franco/Wiseau\'s mouth. They cheered and jeered at all the infamously poor scenes recreated from THE ROOM. Even as someone who loves \'So Bad It\'s Good\' movies myself, I found much of their reaction unsavory. They weren\'t just cheerfully playing along with Wiseau\'s amateurishness, they were ridiculing his accent, his very gall at trying. Unfortunately, I felt some of that crept into Franco\'s movie, even if semi-inadvertently. Compare that with ED WOOD where Tim Burton and screenwriters Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander openly showed great affection for that hapless filmmaker and his cockeyed dream. Franco\'s performance is deeper than Depp\'s in that film, but, it still can\'t save THE DISASTER ARTIST from its failings.']",/posters/xThe.jpg

Believe it or not, if you assume this to be the case right off the bat.. that is actually asking you to suspend your disbelief far LESS then if you don't assume this.So, this hot half vampire chic gets raped and and pushed off a 200 foot cliff and gets impaled through the back, sets the tree on fire to free herself and takes revenge.. now don't worry about that fall she took.. her half vampire side will have its healing powers kick in full strength.

I'd go on but there's no point. If you can suspend your disbelief (you probably won't be able to) you may find it a bit of light fun with a bunch of blood. If you can't, I think you'll find it sucks.

I liked the way the whole thing was filmed, the cuts and everything, reminded me of a Rambo style movie and the actors really get you with their characters. The way the lead turned from an ultimate beautiful babe in the beginning to a bad ass by the end was great. I'd watch this again tbh.

The ONLY good thing about this movie is the cinematography. I am baffled as to why this movie has such a high rating. Maybe it hasn't been watched by many, maybe the people who watched it are part of the problem the industry has with the male gaze. Rape movies are SO overdone and I'm shocked this was directed by a woman. After reading an interview of hers I can see what she tried to do but I will say that she failed. This does not 'flip the script' on the male gaze. All it does is introduce a female gaze and throughout the whole movie the female lead is STILL under the male gaze, STILL scantily clad and STILL sexualized. It's infuriates me. All it does is reminds me of the female characters in video games which are almost always scantily clad.

I watched the movie the other night with my GF and we both were incredibly entertained. I was on the edge of my seat for most the movie. It was a bit hard to watch at times due to how graffic some of the scenes were, however you wont miss much if you look away for a second. I almost skipped the movie due to a rape scene, which i honeslty hate in movies. It ended up being just enough for you to hate a couple of the men, about 15 seconds long. The acting was good. I am so impressed on how entertaining the movie is without much dialogue in the last half. The lead has zero lines in the last hour and still you want her to win the battle. I wont get into detail, but check it out if you like a good suspense/revenge flick.

This film is fun ride in exploitation. Take your feminism triggers elsewhere...it was directed by a woman and as violent as it is, she is doing what many 80\'s slasher films set the table for. Some reviewers actually can\'t settle down enough to realize it\'s an anti-rape film, a spin on anti-misogynistic themes, after a pretty vile table setting in the first act.Some came for plots, writing and realism...IT\'S AN EXPLOITATION HORROR FILM FOR CHRISTS SAKES. While it\'s exploiting, some of these folks forgot about checking their brains at the door and just watching. It ends up taking a turn that is more than satisfactory. Violence begets violence. There is no pretense that gives one a idea that this wouldn\'t be violent, much like I Spit on Your Grave (1978) was before it. Jen somehow manages to outbadass the original ""Jen"" from the aforementioned 70\'s slasher/exploitation classic.The cinematography and tense score are nothing short of brilliant in developing the film and the gore is nothing short of classic upgraded b-movie classic...Minimalistic but somehow doesn\'t feel like it.

Storyline could have been believeable with the whole heist thing. How it is worked and the way it is written, bad - distracts from the action as you roll your eyes.', 'Good action and disaster movie. Just what the title implies.', ""I like cheesy disaster movies. I liked Hurricane Heist much better than last year's Geostorm.Having said that, the acting was mediocre but a lot of that can be blamed on a poor script and awkward dialogue.The CGI was pretty good for quite a low budget film. Fairly steady action throughout the film kept my attention.My previously watched film was The Strangers: Prey At Night so pretty much any other film would get a generous rating from me after that mess."", 'Trailer sums up all the action points. Not good at all...2/10', ""I don't usually review stuff but after watching this movie i was very disappointed and agitated. Its so basic, the main characters never die, hero wins, hero is a trained fighter, hero does everything perfectly but the bad guys always are at a disadvantage, lower combat skill, the inability to run through a hurricane but hero's do, and all die. It is so basic and i've seen it all before.You'd think that the well orginised, smart and deadly criminals would be able to kill 3 people with ease, they managed to take over a maximum security base yet cant kill a single person after. Its too basic.Not one of the heros got shot once either but somehow manage to kill all the criminals even with a car wheel disc, pathetic, and managed to end all of that with a few cuts.This movie is very unrealistic and the heist should have been pulled of with the brothers and the cop dead.i can go on forever but id like to point out one more thing, why is the woman so bothered about the money? Its not personal to her and its getting destroyed anyway, either way they lost it and its going to look like she took it either way so why not just let them take it and not risk your life. Shes literally fighting for no reason, shes basically a psychopath within the movie.Overall the movie is unrealistic and all of that conflict was for no reason. \nIts so bad even i reviewed it to bare peoples brains from viewing such simplicity.Since im on IMBD Id like to get involved in any movie/ acting careers as id make better ideas and scenes than these pathetic troglodytes, other than that i like the visuals and thats it haha, dont enjoy!"", 'When I saw the overall score of 4/10 I didn\'t expect much. It\'s far fetched and unrealistic in a lot of areas. However the 100 minutes flew past. It\'s action packed pretty much all the way through. Ok there\'s some moments of poor acting and there\'s plenty of places you will say to yourself ""no way would that happen"", but overall it\'s well worth watching. Just don\'t expect a blockbuster. I thought giving it 5 was a little unfair so I gave it a 6/10.', 'This movie was a TOP NOTCH action flick. I really enjoyed it. It had some weak acting in some places, was too artificial, but the FX were a charm and movie as a whole was a lot of FUN FUN FUN.', ""Lots of snobby reviews for this but if you like\nNon stop action and special effects, with little to no story, then this is worth a watch.

It is no Citizen Kane but a great action flick from start to finish!', ""People have written reviews saying that it's unrealistic which I found kinda funny. It's not supposed to be realistic.

Wow! And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it."", 'First, let\'s all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can\'t find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let\'s take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it\'s time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It\'s also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can\'t find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can\'t you tell by the music?The police chief isn\'t so bad though, because he has cancer and is spitting up blood. He thinks it\'s best to leave the hospital, because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer. He doesn\'t want his wife and kid\'s final memories of him to be slowly dying in a hospital, so instead their final memories will be of him blowing his own brains out in the barn. Thankfully, a streetwise black police chief came in to take over for the inept and racist white police officers. Now things will finally get done.', ""I can understand how one can adore this film. Of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points, but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. Here are some of my main reservations: - The script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence, while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life, when acting nuts. I dare you to go burn a police station down, remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. Yes, I know McDonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value, but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake). - In a cringeworthy flashback scene, we see the mother and daughter quarrel about Angela going out, only for them to prove their precognitive skills (Angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way, and Mildred agreed with her). Well, I'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why Mildred is filled with remorse. - I thought Rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. McDonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with Rockwell's character that were too comedic, but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie. - Willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. Honestly, I don't get how can a Sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. Supposing he was an ignorant, illiterate redneck, I would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour."", 'Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I\'ve driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she\'s divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it\'s interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn\'t care less about her.WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.Why does Willoughby\'s wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we\'d know these things. As it is, it\'s distracting and elicits questions that shouldn\'t have to be asked. $5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don\'t use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that\'s pretty dumb.A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says ""I didn\'t do it"" and that\'s the end of it?! Really? Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he\'s not even a local, and wasn\'t around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound.', ""The actors are superb, but the script fails in several ways. My immediate reaction, seeing the opening shots, was that this was not Missouri. I guessed it to be the southern Appalachians (where I have spent a lot of time), and so it was. The characters did not behave or speak the way real Southerners speak or behave. Martin McDonagh has written his fantasy of what he thinks Southerners are like. He got it wrong. He works in film sort of the way D. Trump works in politics--he shocks, he amuses, he appeals to our base instincts. But he doesn't tell a coherent story. The central characters are not sympathetic, and indeed they are borderline sociopaths, including Frances McDormand's character. Sam Rockwell's ludicrous cop character would not be tolerated, even in small-town South. Viewers are left to wonder why Woody Harrelson's wife is a much younger luscious babe with a foreign accent. (Also a real Southern man, even a lout like Harrelson's character, would not use foul language in front of his two small daughters.) The period was not clear; observing the cars in the film it seemed to be the 1980s or 90s. Yet there were no computers seen in the police headquarters of the advertising company office. Yet near the end McDormand uses her cell phone. Other reviewers have noted the recurrent racism of the screenplay. I kept wanting to get up and walk out, but stayed for a simple reason. As with any whodunnit, I wanted to find out who did it. Guess what? McDonagh never lets his audience know who did it. As author he must know, yet he keeps this information to himself."", 'I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand\'s performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I\'d have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There\'s a lot of stuff here that doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can\'t explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he\'s down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that ""they"" sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn\'t make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we\'re starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don\'t know anything about, was rather odd.--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that\'s been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That\'s laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she\'s confronted by a guy who suggests he\'s actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn\'t go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it\'s just out of her character and doesn\'t make a lick of sense.--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he\'s completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the ""god-dam blanked""--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it\'s her turn to ""clean the horse *hit"" out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It\'s not called ""*hit"" it\'s called manure and you wouldn\'t even call it that--you\'d just say ""clean the barn"" if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn\'t do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he\'s a good guy. Yeah right.I could go on and on with this but I\'m afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I\'ll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it\'s cracked up to be. It does feel like it\'s a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it\'s more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don\'t make a whole lot of sense.', 'This movie is so obviously trying to be edgy & artsy, it might as well have had someone walking out with a sign at key moments- ""laugh here"" ""gasp here"" ""tear up here"". I love the actors, the characters were super colorful & the movie wasn\'t boring. Other than that, it felt like someone took a template of a dark comedy & then just left out the realism. Going out on a limb here but I\'d say people don\'t normally use the F word & C word that often. Policemen don\'t act like that ...and still have a job. Assault, arson or attempted murder are causes for arrest (even for cops)People don\'t let their friends do jail time for the sake of leaving signs in the street (that was a friend, right?)That 19 year old girl would not be attracted to the exMaking fun dating a little person might have been funny 20 years ago (and then his enlightening \'look in the mirror\' speech as he left the table was ... meh) Also, that was quite a 180 for the vicious, racist cop who throws people out of windows. Too many unrealistic situations & reactions. And why did that random suspect guy come into the shop in the first place? Did he rape someone in Irag? And throw a turtle in there while you\'re at it.Sorry, love the premise, love the actors but sometimes I think critics just have a checklist they go by.', ""The good: performances by Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell, and Lucas Hedges (despite not having much screen time.) There were some moments that were pretty cool and did some new things, but overall this film isn't worth much. It is basically a string of mean people going along and doing mean things, to no end. Nobody learns anything, the little growth that does occur is quite forced, and a lot of it doesn't seem very grounded in reality. The tone is confused, bouncing back and forth between Nickelodeon comedy and a dark drama, making it hard to take seriously. Woody Harrelson seemed to care so little about his voice-over work in the middle of the film, but that's understandable when the writers didn't seem to care much either. The editing wasn't great and offered unclear communication at times. I don't know who picked Abbie Cornish for this, or anything, as she is an exceptionally poor actress. I think we're supposed to be emphasizing with the main character, but that's hard to do when she's a callous wrecking ball. Making a film about a parent dealing with trauma of this nature is a great premise, but there's a certain humanity lacking. I disconnected with this film when she didn't take the billboards down the moment her friend got arrested. I assumed it was a given- how could you let your friend rot away in jail while this futile ploy of yours is the single cause? And how was the friend OK with that upon being released? This is not a strong person, this is a petty and immature person who is seeking solace purely for selfish reasons. It is also completely overlooked that she is harming her still-alive son throughout the course of all this. Finally, we have one scene with Mildred's daughter, who is the cause of all events that take place in the film. Not only was the actress incapable of carrying this scene, but it was also hard to believe she was the daughter of Mildred. Overall, an unaware film that seemed to try to be catering to the current political climate."", 'Seriously, any critic that says this movie is somewhat good, should chance his job. Is the acting great? Yes\nIs the story-idea great? Yes\nIs the execution great? No way. It almost never happens that i yell at a screen in anger because a storyplot is so unrealistic that it hurts. But here it happend. The scene where Officer Dick throws out the advertising guy of the window and then just sits within his station, nobody arresting him, not even the new Chief that clearly saw it and fires him would arrest him - well, this is just not even in the united states of police brutality realistic and just ruins the whole movie for me. From there on, the movie was just a pain. And im almost never not on the line of critics...dont understand it.', 'I went into this movie with big expectations. I loved the trailer and Sam Rockwell never disappoints. The movie touched lots of modern society\'s problems as Trumps presidency, priests that molest children and the church\'s ""acceptance"" or rather ignorance concerning this huge problem, racist cops and the problematic handling and prejudices many cops have against people of color. \nThe scene were Frances McDormand confronts the priest in her kitchen stuck with me the most. All actors deliver great performances, especially Rockwell and McDormand. I do somehow feel like the movie and especially the topic had more potential. Some scenes felt so out of place and should have been cut from the movie (the deer scene and where Woody Harrelson says ""goodbye"" to his wife). It scratched the surface of so many topics, when instead it could have gone more in depth with the topic of rape culture and how the police handles the investigations. However, I did like the humor and that it didn\'t feel forced but natural. It didn\'t ridicule or disrespect the very problematic topic but pointed out how ridiculously fucked up the system and society is.', ""This is a bad movie, the hype is just critics BS. The plot is stupid and makes almost no sense. Specifically b/c the three billboards pose a question to another character (Harrelson) and he answers that question to the protagonist(McDormand) within the first 10 minutes of the movie. His answer to the question on the billboards is completely reasonable, but of course the protagonist isn't satisfied. Short of a few comical lines, the movie isn't funny. Also, there are no characters to root for throughout the movie. In addition to all the characters being either racist, hateful, or stupid (all three?), the main character is unlikable, and that is also stated later in the movie. The one good part of the movie is the realization by the protagonist that they are selfish person who is actually doing everything for them self and hurting everyone else around them b/c they are miserable. The ending is also bad and is not really an ending."", ""I really wanted to like this film. But it has plot holes you could fly a 747 through. The characters do completely nonsensical things. And for the love of God, if you're going to make a place a character in your movie, at least actually film it in that state. Like maybe ... I don't know ... In Bruges?"", 'I went to see this movie because I hadn\'t seen any trailers to it. It\'s something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can\'t even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favourite movie of the year (2017...Ofc.)', 'Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year\'s most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It\'s the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who\'s been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn\'t he stick with the stage if that\'s his primary area of expertise?).McDonagh\'s strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with ""hearts of gold"" so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department\'s inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes\' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.McDonagh\'s other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes\' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby\'s suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What\'s up with that?).Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff\'s Willoughby\'s death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. It\'s at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he\'s not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby\'s letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man\'s DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes\' daughter\'s death.With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes\' daughter\'s death, as they are convinced he\'s guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they\'re talking to one another in the car, it\'s probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have ""learned their lesson,"" and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become ""good""-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh\'s willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter\'s moral compass.Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned ""baser instincts""; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages.', ""it's unfortunate to use the word comedy, dark or otherwise, with regard to this film. unpleasant would be a better adjective. if you've seen the trailer you know what the billboards are about. if not, you'll know when you see the movie. revenge and guilt are being served up cold. deep down, apparently, every one has a heart of gold. racists, wife beaters. whatever. I did not buy it. others have."", ""I've never had such an unpleasant feeling watching a movie before. The characters are awful people, sociopaths even. Frances McDormands character at first comes across as just being a broken woman, but a flashback scene shows that her character was never a pleasant person. Her ex-husband likes to poke fun at the towns little person like he's still in junior high. Sam Rockwells character is the worst. He tortures a black kid, punches a young lady in the face, throws a city clerk out a two-story window for no reason at all. But yet, the writers thought that his character needed a redemption angle. Are you freakin kidding me?? His character belonged behind bars. Aside from this, the script was just awful. People talking in ways that people just don't talk. Things thrown in there that didn't make sense. Why was this military veteran from Idaho, who had nothing to do with the girls murder, and who's never been to Ebbing before, just show up and start harassing a dead girls mother? Also, the characters in this movie do things that would ordinarily land a person in county jail, or even prison. But, they go completely unscathed. But, lets not ignore the biggest goof of all, the wife of Woody Harrelsons character suddenly out of nowhere develops a British accent.The producers must have spent some good money on fake reviews, because I can't see how so many film critics can find this movie to be great."", 'I want to love this, as I get the main premise. However, there were a lot of quirks that just didn\'t fit. Things that didn\'t scan. Prime example was Sam Rockwell\'s character, office Dixon. It\'s like they tried to paint him as a one-dimensional, racist bad guy who redeems himself, but then add more layers that didn\'t really add/take away from him. Just filler for no reason. And what he does should have gotten him arrested not suspended. Unrealistic.The dad was just dumb, but then they pull back on the throttle and he\'s okay. Then he\'s a dick again. I get that the writer/director is trying to add depth, but it just came out as confusion over the character and his motivations. Him saving the file was stupid. As stupid as her burning down the cop shop and him beating up the ad guy.Honestly, I rooted for Mildred the least. I found her to be the least sympathetic character in the entire movie, and she was a mom who lost her daughter to a horrific crime. I get it, it changes you and a person who goes through that will never be the same, but damn. I found it almost impossible to root for her. And her little dumb conversations with her slippers and dear? Not cute or informative. Just dumb and it made the character look nuts.I rooted for the sheriff the most. Here\'s a good cop who really wanted to solve the case and bring in the bad guy. Not for Mildred or himself, but because it was the right thing to do and it was his job. The dynamic of him having incurable cancer was interesting, and the one time I actually liked Mildred was during their interrogation scene when his cancer interrupts his smug ""gotcha"" speech. She\'s so awesome to him and he to her. The one true, shining moment of humanity in this. The movie would have been better served telling the story from the sheriff\'s point of view and ending with him.6/10, but that\'s an aggregate. There were some real 1/10 and 10/10 moments.', 'What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazing job and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a very serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went to the Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, do I consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing.

If you thought 'Black Swan' was pretentious, well you haven't yet seen writer-director Darren Aronofsky's latest self-aggrandizing piece of 'artistic filmmaking'.The titular character is never named, and as played by Jennifer Lawrence, is the adoring wife of an also unnamed middle-aged poet â referred to as 'Him' (Javier Bardem) â stuck in writer's block. They live in a gorgeous octagonal Victorian mansion, which she is painstakingly renovating. We find out later that the house was burned down in a fire which consumed her husband's first wife, and that he had pulled from the ashes a burnished crystal which he now displays proudly in his study.Then out of the blue, a stranger (Ed Harris) turns up at their doorstep. He says he's an orthopaedic surgeon who's looking for a place to stay, and that he had mistaken their house for a bed-and- breakfast. To her horror, 'Him' invites the 'man' to stay; and by the next day, his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) arrives, followed by their two quarrelling sons (Domhnall and Brian Gleeson). Before the day is over, one son will bludgeon and accidentally kill the other, resulting in a pool of blood on the wooden floorboards that she will scrub clean save for a patch shaped in a vagina.It doesn't take a genius to see the parallel with the Cain and Abel story in the Bible, or the 10 plagues that make a brief appearance one by one. Those familiar with Aronofosky will know that he has been fascinated with Christianity â from his first feature 'Pi' to 'Noah' to 'The Fountain', Aronofsky has consistently drawn allegories and imagery from Biblical stories. 'Mother!' is no different, but there is no coherence, no logic and no purpose in his references here.The anything-goes, anyhow-told narrative has unwelcome strangers turning up at her house to mourn the death of the 'man's' son, an unleashing of pent-up passion between her and 'Him', her unexpected pregnancy afterwards that lets her morph into the Virgin Mary, her husband's sudden inspiration and overnight success, the arrival of cult followers that want to use her newborn son as blood sacrifice, and last but not least plenty of sectarian wars and conflict that culminate in a full cycle of destruction and reincarnation. Only those enamoured with 'bullshit' will think that revealing any of these unexpected twists and turns amounts to 'spoilers'; but really, it's a lot of shock-and-awe wrapped around a bastardisation of notable Biblical tales for absolutely nothing.Indeed, even more absurd than the movie itself is how some have tried so strenuously to justify its nonsense. One reading has it as an allegory for the abuse of Mother Earth, a warning for climate change; another explains how it describes the process by which art is created and how the artist eventually becomes a slave to that art; another talks about how some men have treated their women in marriage, reducing them to supporting roles and robbing them of agency and respect. Neither of these interpretations disguises the fact that the movie is a haphazard mess of ideas that never amounts to anything substantial or compelling.Why then should we put up with its misogyny? Why then should we put up with the overwrought delirium that just gets more and more sickening? Or more fundamentally, why should we even care about what's happening on screen? Not even Lawrence, or Bardem, or Harris, or Pfeiffer can add depth to their characters, which are so thinly written that we wonder why the actors even bothered. And therein lies the stark truth about the madness we are supposed to discern as an expression of profound ideas â there is simply nothing behind it, no meaning, no wit and certainly no redemption.'Mother!' is the sad product of an artist's self-indulgence taken to its own grotesque extremes. It is no art, it is no genius, and it is definitely no masterpiece, despite critics caught up in the same pretension will try to convince you. If you're curious about why we hated it so much, then go see it by all means; otherwise, stay away from this motherf**king disaster."", ""First, I must laugh at all the reviews of people who had no idea what they were watching. We must all realize that all films are not written for all people who watch. Just as I usually do not go see cartoon films, others should give good thought before seeing such an 'artsy' film as Mother!. Hey, if you didn't like Black Swan, think more than twice on this one.Observation: There is a fire. Woman's face burning up. When cut to Javier holding a crystal. He places the crystal on a metal stand and we watch the house start healing itself, starting at that crystal. We cut to other parts of the house, as it heals, from fire back to normal. Eventually we cut to a bedroom where we see the bed healing itself and someone under the covers. She arises and it is Mother, played by Jennifer. Odd names for a film, right, but the names are never said in the film. We learn that Him is an accomplished poet, but it seems like he is going through some type of writer's block. Mother's mission is to refinish the house. A lot has been done, but there is always more work to do. A man played by Ed Harris knocks at the door and Him greets the man and allows him to enter, almost happy someone else is in the house. The man is a doctor, but he smokes and drinks which causes him getting sick, fairly easily. It doesn't bother Him, but Mother is quite concerned.Soon someone else arrives, a woman played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Turns out the woman is the man's wife. She's a feisty one played convincingly by Pfeiffer. Mother seems confused why Him allows these strangers to stay in their house. The woman doesn't hold anything back when she has a conversation with Mother. The woman asks why they don't have a baby? Mother is pretty taken back by how forward the woman is. This does not bother the drunk woman.The man & woman seem to find a fascination with the crystal. Mother tells them not to touch it, but eventually they sneak in the room and break it into 100's of pieces. Him becomes enraged! Mother wants the man and woman to leave, but they don't and it's seems Mother is powerless. Mother goes to their room and they are having sex so she leaves. Even though Him is very upset he does not ask them to leave. Are you putting the pieces together? 2 more guests, 2 sons arrive. They fight, one becomes badly hurt & Him, the man & woman take him to the hospital, but Him comes back and tells Mother he died. Soon people start showing up, apparently for the funeral for the son and as more arrive things become chaotic. Every person seems to represent something different. The house becomes a disaster as everyone starts stealing everything! After everyone leaves Him & Mother have a fight which turns into sex. After Mother says she is pregnant. Him then becomes inspired to write a new poem. He gives it to Mother to read. She cries and tells Him it is magnificent. People start showing up again to praise Him for his poem. It is at this point things start to become totally chaotic. Let's just say lots of people show up and Aronofsky puts things in overdrive! The insanity on the screen is brilliant and here is why I believe this\x85 Interpretation: The film is basically an allegory our entire existence, and then some. Him is G*d. Mother is Mother Nature or as Him calls her, home. Him creates man and woman as Mother Nature creates everything around them. The Poem is the Bible. The house is the world. The man is Adam, the woman Eve. The sons Cain & Abel. We then basically witness an insane, quick review from Christ to present time (about 20 minutes), and then the demise of mankind. The film's use of the crystal represents the 'Apple'.Conclusion: When we look at this film in its entirety, taking 2 steps back, we see the film summarizes man's existence. The beginning of the film shows he tried before, but failed. Our existence, most of the film, also fails. At the end, we see Him try once again. G*d's dilemma is free will. Him only leads by verse (the Bible), but man's interpretation is what creates conflict, as everyone has their own interpretation, thus anarchy eventually occurs & eventually obliteration. Eden gets a restart, over & over again.I find the film to be amazing in scope, like Cloud Atlas or A's The Fountain. Like I said earlier, if you don't appreciate films like these, or even Black Swan don't bother. It's simply not your brand. I feel the film is an amazing encapsulation of our existence performed in very unique fashion. The message here is strong. I prefer the avant-garde probably because I've seen so many films. I need to view films that present something new, and this one certainly does. For me, it is a masterpiece. Aren't artists allowed to target their audience? They all can't have happy endings. My 1000 words worth."", 'The principle rule of allegory is that it must function on two levels - the plain narrative, what the audience sees or reads, and the metaphorical, the level beyond the seen or read, usually conveying a deeper meaning. An allegory which fails as a narrative is a morality play; an allegory that fails on the metaphorical level is a nonsensical tale. mother! fails on both levels, and the result is a confusing mess as likely to bore as it is to disgust. The script is stark, but as opposed to offering up a Hemingway-esque brevity and punch, it instead descends to the level of drive by dialogue, actors delivering short statements with blank expressions and then leaving the room they\'re in. Granted, the actors only had Aronofsky\'s script to work with, and he\'s on record as saying it only took five days to write, which is visible in every scene. An undergrad brags about finishing their paper the night before it\'s due; a screenwriter should not laud a similar process for his film. The only film that comes close to the delivery in mother! is The Room, which may very well be the superior of the two. And if you told me that Bardem, normally a captivating actor, had modeled his performance of Him on Wiseau\'s Johnny, I would readily believe you.In fact, the only actor who brings any life to this joyless epic is Pfeiffer, whose facial expressions and tone elevate her sniping dialogue far above the written quality. She\'s also the only one who brings any passion to her role, as Lawrence seems to have been reduced to two speeds - blank expression and monotone speech, or screaming so hard she cracks a rib. All granularity seen in her previous performances is gone here. The characters portrayed by normally fine actors are so small, so one dimensional, one barely cares about them as people, let alone as stand ins for something larger than themselves. I could muster neither sympathy nor even vague interest in the foibles and woes of this couple, nor their never-ending torrent of house guests. (Judging by the laughs in the theater, I wasn\'t the only one.) Their tragedies in the final third were grating, not because they were disgusting, or shocking, but because I was never interested in them to begin with. The setting is a perfect mirror to Lawrence\'s acting, if not her character. The film takes places in a rustic, half finished house. As before with the script, any attempt at a spare beauty is never realized, and the end result looks like the set designers didn\'t want to spend too much time on something they knew would literally be ripped apart in the final act. The house is our only setting in this film, so its lack of visual interest is a massive detriment. The cinematography is likewise lackluster, with nothing special to either set it apart or condemn it. It is filmed adequately. The story and performances were clearly meant to be the jewel here, a situation analogous to purchasing a workable frame only to enshrine pages from the 1988 Albuquerque phone book therein. And since I brought up analogy, the elephant in the room, the roughshod Biblical allegory. Said allegory falls flat on its face as soon as its analyzed in the slightest. Lawrence is Aronofsky\'s self insertion character (in the style of bad fan fiction) to the Christian canon, a Gaia character who forms an unbalanced duality with Him, the writer\'s presentation of the Christian God. Him is never very godlike, and his standing as ""God"" is simply revealed to us at the end, a classic example of telling and not showing. While observant viewers may be able to deduce his role from context earlier in the film, he is never characterized in a way that makes his stated role fit his perceived role. An allegory is not proclaiming a character to be other than they have been observed by way of a brief statement at the end. The titular mother, the self insertion Gaia character, has a similar problem - she demonstrates none of the qualities common to portrayals of Mother Earth figures in fiction. Instead, she is aloof, credulous, and dense. If the point intended to be made was Aronofsky\'s self-proclaimed howl about the treatment of the planet, perhaps he should have created a Mother Earth figure that was remotely sympathetic, or relatable. What we have instead is a distant robot whose demise was met with yawns. The revelation, easily predicted from the first scene, that this is a cycle these characters have been locked in since time immemorial, fails to shock or elicit a reaction, unless one counts exasperation. It also drives the allegory firmly off the rails, moving our underlying mythology from a Christian creation and eschatology to something more Eastern, with reality a cyclical illusion. There was an opportunity here for a valid story to be told on multiple levels. We live in an era of man made climate change and contemporary Christianity is ripe for criticism. A more skilled writer and director could have pulled off a tale that would be as heartbreaking as it was true. And perhaps Aronofsky could have done that, had he taken his time and revised even the slightest bit. (However, as this is his second failure in a row that deals with Biblical themes, perhaps not.)What we are treated to instead is the cinematic equivalent of soda crackers and a brief lecture by an inarticulate first year undergrad about religion and environmentalism. I wish I could end this with the famous quotation from King Lear, but it\'s not entirely accurate. We were only given the idea of sound and fury, not the genuine article. This film is the shadow of a shadow, and in that, at least, it does signify nothing.', ""I saw this at TIFF and the point this movie was trying to make became clear fairly early on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but as the story developed, the analogies and symbolism went into overkill, to the point where their excessive nature diminished what was an interesting story.The movie is helmed by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, two actors I'm particularly fond of. The short summary of this movie is that they are a couple who live in a beautiful, remote home. One night they take in an unwanted house guest (Harris), more at Bardem's choosing than Lawrence's. This leads to countless other house guests and invasions from the outside world, often to the detriment of Bardem & Lawrence's beautiful home, and Lawrence's well-being. As the movie goes on, these violations against the home and Lawrence get increasingly bizarre and excessive. They get laid on so thick that, even if you have figured out the analogy by the midway point of the movie and enjoy the way the movie is getting it's point across, the sheer madness that transpires in the second half of the film is likely to sour you on the overkill applied to the message. It becomes fairly apparent that the house and Lawrence's character from which the movie is titled represent our planet. Bardem's character represents a creator/God (in credits, his character is simply known as 'Him'). Harris and Pfeiffer, the original, invasive guests, are the original Man & Woman (Adam & Eve), and from there, a lot of the plot initially descends from biblical references and then into His desire to provide for his followers and to be adored by them, ignorant of how detrimental they are to the house and Mother. At the very end, the house becomes overpopulated with people who are both zealots and warmongers who descend into utter 'WTF' madness while they destroy the home, murder the couple's child, and force Mother to burn down the home she so painstakingly created, killing everyone inside it. After the fire, He carries her out, and recreates the home with a new Mother. As I said, it's a story thick on symbolism and message. I personally liked what they were going for, but think it could have been a much better movie if they had done it far subtly than with the extreme overkill they employed in the second half of this film. Looking at the reviews, I see a lot of people torn by this movie, and I think for these reasons. Some people didn't clue into the message very well and just thought it was a movie that made no sense. Others may not have liked the pro-environment analogies, while some may have loved how excessive the movie hammered it's point home. Another group likely felt how I did - that the plot and point was unique and interesting, but the sheer madness the film careened into during the second half was extremely excessive.Overall, I give it a 6/10, with disappointment that a promising concept wasn't executed more sensibly."", 'I was in the right mood for a smart horror film, they used to be my favorite kind of film until they sort of disappeared, the smart part not the horror. I\'m a huge fan of Polanski\'s The Tenant - it terrified me more than any other film, followed shortly by 2 other Roman Polanski masterpieces, Repulsion and Rosemary\'s Baby. There are others - Nicolas Roeg\'s Don\'t Look Now, Martin Donovan\'s Apartment Zero, Alex De La Iglesias\'s La Comunidad, Davin Lynch\'s Eraserhead and Blue Velvet in particular. Most of Luis Bunuel\'s work and a few others. Mother! reminded me somehow of some of them but it was just like a tease that didn\'t really matured into anything.Here everything is outrageously on the nose but not in a phenomenal Ken Russell way but in a rather obvious, unconvincing, ""look at me"" kind of thing. I love Jennifer Lawrence but in Mother! she wakes up at the beginning of the film and she\'s already panicky. Please, don\'t misunderstand me, I\'m not suggesting a prequel! No, clearly Darren Aronfski gave the audience too much credit or not enough because for me, as a member of the audience, left me cold. I may have winced at the sight of blood but it didn\'t frighten me. The ""wound"" on the floor? Remember the hole in the wall of ""The Tenant""? Maybe it\'s my fault. I\'ve seen too many films and young audiences haven\'t. I\'ve read some of the positive comments and I imagine they are from very young people who feel, quite rightly, they been given something besides Marvel and they have. I only hope they use it as a gateway to discover some of the ""old"" films. And as for Mother! what I enjoyed was the totally unexpected turn by Michelle Pfeiffer. Dark and funny, mocking or better still, paying tribute to Ruth Gordon - I imagine. I left the theater with a desperate need to revisit Rosemary\'s Baby and you know what? I will. So after all said and done, thank you.', 'Darren Aronfsky is a director I follow, even since Pi. He\'s daring and unpredictable. I loved Requiem For A Dream and Black Swan, the rest of his opus has left me puzzled or downright annoyed. Mother! belongs to the later. All the element\'s were there - Rosemary\'s Baby written by Edward Albee - that\'s what I thought right up to Michelle Pfeiffer\'s entrance, then something happened - The movie falls through a totally unbelievable, hysterical downward spiral. What? Yes, exactly. Jennifer Lawrence suffers, puffs and moans from the very first frame, well second frame. She\'s afraid from the word go. She could run away but for some reason she never ventures out of the house. Questions like that become a massive obstacle for us to care and feel connected - Think of Mia Farrow in Rosemary\'s Baby or Colin Firth in Apartment Zero - co-habitating with a devil, surrounded by sinister neighbors or unwanted visitors. Those films also had sensational scripts and the narrative even when symbolic was always solidly based on the story at hand - Here it feels like gimmicks - One idea and then round and round the mulberry bush. I don\'t know how many times she shouts at her husband ""Please make them leave"" - Jennifer Lawrence goes through it valiantly and vociferously. Javier Bardem as the egomaniacal husband is absurdly unconvincing - and I\'m a devoted a fan - Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who brings something new to the proceedings and a truly startling performance. Other than that, I\'m sorry to say no to Mother!', 'First of all, please don\'t watch this film if you have trouble understanding metaphors & symbolism.It\'s pretty clear that there are quite a number of reviews/rants on this page with people expressing their hate towards the story and how it\'s been portrayed on screen. It\'s strange because it looks like they had absolutely no idea what they were watching... it\'s trivial and shallow to publish a review without any research. However, I do agree that it isn\'t an easy one to sit through, but some of the greatest films aren\'t. So again, please don\'t bother checking it out if your mind is closed, you won\'t appreciate this masterpiece.To help deter unaccommodating opinions being regurgitated, I\'ll try to explain what made the film worth your time.I believe there are two themes that can be interpreted from Mother!! Therefore, the use of an additional explanation mark is required.***SPOILERS BELOW***Religious Theory;Pretty sure the inconvenient truth to this theory is that when the sh*t hits the fan, mother doesn\'t like people messing up her house (Earth). Apparently, Darren Aronofsky is not religious but he likes strong environmental messages. He also wrote the script in 5 days.. how long did it take God to create the world? Just saying.Jennifer Lawrence is (Mother) Earth â The house is Earth.Javier Bardem (Him) is God â Creator of life on Earth, loves attention, and forgives everyone.Ed Harris (Man) is Adam â Invited by God to Earth (aka house)Michelle Pfeiffer (Woman) is Eve â Created from Adam\'s rib (scene where Ed Harris was sick on the toilet)The crystal is the forbidden fruit (apple)The baby is the bread at the last supper ""Body of Christ""Relationship Theory;An extreme version of anxiety in a relationship that is deteriorating. The tense build-up in social interactions and how someone may view a scenario where they feel left out and forgotten. The jealousy someone feels when their bond is shared. Not paying attention to the needs of one another in a relationship. Having a baby to keep the relationship alive. All these emotions are magnified/multiplied by 100 to the point it\'s literally terrifying, so crazy that it may make you laugh. Finally, once the love has completely diminished, the only thing left is to leave and start again new.Either way, this film is unique and original in the way it\'s portrayed, packaged and presented. Hope you can appreciate the beauty of this Gothic religious tale / art-house opera and award the actors & production team that helped make it possible.', 'I really like D. Aronofsky\'s films. As a whole, he has a solid corpus.This film, however, had significant structural problems which shake its foundation as a film.The film is split into two parts...Why? It\'s not clear. It\'s also not clear what the two plot-lines mean. There is not ""real"" connection to piece them together and the viewer is pushed to create their own...This viewer sees a meaningless old testament - new testament relationship. But interplay? Not much. There seems to be a Cane and Able story in the first half. You know what happens... But how this is relevant to the main actors (the husband and wife) who take this couple and, subsequently, their two sons in. The husband and wife host the big family argument. Why? Dunno?The second half, when J. Lawrence, has her child, we are thrust into a tired boy-Jesus plot line and his subsequent sacrifice a la New Testament plot themes. But why? And what do these two halves of the movie have to do with one another...apart from the first being an old testament story and the second being one from the new testament.The ending is violent and contrived, yet is a very good dream sequence, albeit Lawrence is not dreaming (or is he?).Two old Polanski homages, albeit super-heavy-handed, incessantly bombard you throughout the movie...The Apartment and Rosemary\'s Baby. But is it an homage or just meaningless lifting of motifs? The hole in the wall and the bloody hole (aka vagina) are direct parallels. As is the baby sacrifice or offering in both.All in all it was watchable. Had some interesting points. Good camera work. Good effects. But the story doesn\'t hold up on any level, except in the mind of some viewers who need to stitch it together and make sense of it themselves in their own way...Perhaps that was the abstract goal.', ""Went to see this film hoping that it would be a decent one but very disappointed, wanted to leave after 1 hr but stayed in case things got better how wrong was that!! The film has a good cast but the plot is numbingly boring it is like a remake of 'Rosemary's Baby' but with more people than you would find at rush hour on the district line at the end of it. I cannot recommend this film to anyone."", ""In a nutshell..... The story of a writer-blocked poet (Bardem) and his beautiful young wife (Lawrence) who has adoring fans (including Ed Harris and his wife Michelle Pfeiffer) that flock to his home just to be in his presence. Forgive the run on sentence........Harris is dying of cancer, his two sons arrive to fight over his money, get into a fistfight and one gets killed, more fans arrive, Lawrence goes into labour, fans start to riot, tearing the house apart, she has the baby, he wants to show his fans, she says no, he sits and stares at her for days, she falls asleep, he takes the baby, shows his fans, they grab the baby, kill it and eat it, Mom goes nuts, runs to the basement with a wrench, bashed a hole in the oil tank and sets it on fire and blows up the whole place, Bardem carries her charred body, sets her down and proceeds to reach in her chest and take out her heart, with her permission. He squeezes her heart til it turns to glass, sets it in a stand, the next scene there's a new wife and the whole thing starts over again. There! Just saved you $10........you're welcome!"", 'Him is the God, the creator! Mother is the mother earth. Mother gives form and maintains the structure. God first invites Adam (the old man). Then from Adam\'s rib God creates Eve. Do you remember the scene in which Man\'s rib was wounded and he was throwing up?Adam and Eve break the forbidden crystal (they ate the forbidden fruit).Then we see the story of Abel and Cane. Cane kills Abel. Then mother\'s house, the earth, is populated with various religions and various ideologies. All of which pray God (or Him). But they become aggressive. They start to betray the earth. And then the story of Jesus. Mother becomes Mary. It gives birth to Jesus. But Jesus followers eat him alive. They eat his blood and his flesh (wine and bread). And the story continues. The way the humanity is heading, Mother earth is doomed.I liked the symbolism in this movie. But to me, as a semi-Nietzschean thinker, mother is the real God. For God is not separated from mother. God is mother\'s creation. Mother = Earth. I finish with this quote from Nietzsche:""Remain faithful to the (mother) earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away. Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I doâback to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning.""', ""30+ years of watching movies and never created an account. That is how bad this movie was, it made me want to contribute to a lower rating. I would rate it negative 10 if I could. Anyone who tries to sell it as an allegory should never be allowed to review anything ever again. I respect everyone's opinions, but don't even think about trying to sell it with that justification. Literally the worst excuse for a movie ever.

Darren doesn't care what you or some critic thinks, he did this because he had to. We are killing ourselves and our MOTHER and this is an artful yet harsh, radical reminder of that.Watch this film so that more chances can be made in Hollywood.

From the burned heart turning into a crystal (it would really turn to ash that would float away) to the patch of blood shaped like a vagina that refuses to go away, this is a film that wallows in self- indulgence and, despite what some critics may say, lacks originality.

Yet, a film like Mother! can still come along and disgust audiences. A film so off-putting, Rex Reed declared it ""The worst film of the century"". Make no mistake, Mother! is a profoundly polarizing film. But that is only because it went mainstream. It stars mainstream actors. It\'s distributed by Paramount. In recent years, the art-house and the multiplex have never crossed paths. But as the era of the blockbuster fades away, it was only a matter of time for Hollywood to return back to it\'s roots. To bring us back to the late 1960\'s, where most films meant something. Films that grab you. Films that push serious boundaries. I rarely leave a theater shaken. But Mother! did just that. It is a beautiful, terrifying assault on your senses.Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem play a lovely couple. Bardem is a struggling poet, while Lawrence tends to her house obsessively. Everything seems fine on the surface. What\'s that, you ask? The house has a heart! I admit the deed! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It\'s the beating of his hideous heart! ... and scene. Thank you for indulging me. No seriously, the house has a heart.. and internal organs. It\'s a living entity. I heard of the phrase ""Home is where the heart is"" but this is ridiculous. Is it? Lawrence plays someone that wants to be a mother to something. Her house? What happens when adoring fans come rushing in to see Bardem? Unwelcome visitors all! They wreck the house and impede on Lawrence\'s hard work. This must not go on. To fill the void, Bardem and Lawrence conceive a child. As the days go on, the guest list becomes bigger and bigger. By the film\'s midpoint, the house becomes a small city of thieves and squatters. After that, I must not share anymore. Because if you\'re already confused by what I\'m telling you.. you don\'t know what confused is, my friend.How does one interpret Mother! It\'s the quintessential art-house/midnight movie. Therefore, anything is plausible. Aronofsky intended it that way. He juggles many concepts and critiques about life itself. Motherhood, paranoia, fame, claustrophobia, selfishness, lust, rage, war, peace, religion, gender, history.. Mother! is whatever you want it to be and more. If you know that going in, this will be a breeze. If you don\'t, you will loathe every second of this film and I won\'t blame you. It is a lot to swallow. The climax of the picture is well orchestrated insanity. Arguably, the most intense sequence of events captured on screen since Children of Men. By comparison, Requiem for a Dream is almost entirely palpable. You sit back in your seat and think ""Enough already. This is too much. Wow. It\'s not stopping. Please stop."". But that is precisely the point. Aronofsky does not let up until you are mentally drained from watching. But at least to ease some of the pain, you see a lot of Jennifer Lawrence\'s face, up-close. Most of the film is on her face. In real life, she is in a relationship with Aronofsky. Coincidence? No, not a coincidence. This is the mark of a filmmaker madly in love with his star. On an emotional level, that shows.Mother! is not a film to go into blind.. but that certainly helps the experience. Polarizing, disturbing films are not crowd pleasures by any stretch, but that\'s never been an area that bothers me. Films like these fascinate me. Their lack of decorum fascinates me. The reactions from the audience fascinate me. On Lars Von Trier\'s best day, he couldn\'t have conjured a film like Mother! .. and if he did, he would\'ve have let it be seen in a shopping mall.', ""Maybe the intention was to make a terrifying comedy about, about, about...well, I'm not sure. A Mother! like that with an exclamation mark? An artist with an ego bigger than their house? Who knows. I certainly tried to cling on to something but I couldn't. It seems like a terrible confession to make but the truth is I couldn't care less about that mother because I didn't believe in her plight and couldn't understand her behavior. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress we all know that but here, she screams and screams while I glanced at my watch with mounting impatience. Borrowing from other, better films, doesn't help, on the contrary, it irritates. Rosemary's Baby came to mind as well as The Tenant, Apartment Zero, Common Wealth. All films that terrified me without explicit gore and superb screenplays. Mother! seems like an interesting idea totally derailed by an out of control ego.""]",/posters/xMother!Â (2017).jpg
The DepartedÂ (2006) ,(2006),8.5,2h 31min,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']",R,An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.,Martin Scorsese,William Monahan,"['Leonardo DiCaprio,', 'Matt Damon,', 'Jack Nicholson']","[""Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.Some things are better than in the original (Infernal Affairs) like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character (not really for other character). However the scene, when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob, takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust (in one year and a half to two years), which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min.Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion: -The death of Wong/Queenan: in IA, Wong falls suddenly, lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but also/mainly by the loss of his friend. In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slow-mo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection, no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop.-The death of Sam/Costello: In IA, Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid, he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate.In The Departed, although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city, when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his a-s-s. Never after he seems like he might become good.-The elevator and final scene: In IA, the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional, all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots.In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut, the token black guy shows up, the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed.And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is over-the-top street violence while the other one is more subdued, concise and nuanced.For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it :) The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.The Departed 8/10 Infernal Affairs 9/10"", 'Just watched it last night and can\'t help but think how much better the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was compare to ""The Departed."" The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn\'t make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess\' trade mark violence and sex.I didn\'t feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn\'t help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy\'s inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.I couldn\'t feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn\'t sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn\'t feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn\'t feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn\'t feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but ""Mr. French"" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack\'s character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in ""The Departed"" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg\'s existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn\'t have to do it alone.""The Departed"" is a good movie if only it wasn\'t a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie.Watch the original if you haven\'t seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters.', ""They sure know how to make their version real 'American' with all the F words. That seriously was annoying, how every actor in the movie always needed to curse, I should have counted them.The original (Infernal Affairs/Mou gaan dou) is way better.Why? Cause the most important key was missing! In the original movie; the mole (Chan Wing Yan (as Tony Leung)) in the mafia gang had a great bond with the head guy of the entire case. He gave him a watch for his birthday. At that moment you could see how those two has a bond with each other. That would explain the grief that he showed in the movie when the head guy got killed.The American re-film: Billy and Queenan totally had NO connection in my eyes. All Dignam could do was bash him with the f words. Why the hell would Billy give a crap that Queenan died? They had no bond. I think supposedly in both movies the death of the head guy was the twist in the cases. The both moles (mafia side aswel the police side) realized this cannot continue anymore. Afterwards they had to take strong measurements to the case. That all cause of the death of that head guy.So yeah, I advice everybody to watch the original one first. I think this movie is too overrated. I sure hope they won't re-film part II and III of Infernal Affairs (it is possible you know...)."", ""Before starting I must confess to watching this film never having seen the original and without realizing there was one. After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film.But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits, of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me.Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points: - Gangster Nicholson allows former cop (who he knows is a former cop) DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang.Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio, his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break.The whole film falls apart right there - if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on.DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss, but he is still above suspicion.Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson - and there is no investigation? Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records (a very easy thing to do) Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl.Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy.Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense.The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed.Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality - but he sure can't play it well.Err, the State Police in central Boston? No - that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD.Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later.And now for the pointless time wasters: Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts (or lack thereof) to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour (felt like four hours) film and convoluted story telling The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely *no* purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining.The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film.The stupid porno/hooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless, plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess.The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro.The sex scene was just sillyNow let's throw in some bad casting/bad directing decisions: - Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles, both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences - waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged.Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns.The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through.OK - so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little, which is why it deserves so few marks from me.The one star, if I must give one, is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick."", 'Make it long, add top star billing, and spend a zillion dollars, and I guess anything can receive an award. Silly me, I thought original, provocative, and at the very least, plausible story telling was needed for good drama.Let me start by adding, that ""great"" actors are useless when miss-cast. I\'m sorry, but Damon and DiCaprio\'s persona\'s and looks are both too soft to play hard edge characters. Wahlberg and Sheen were so absent of realism, they compromised important plot dialog. Baldwin\'s attempt to add some comic flare came across as more buffoonery then wit. Even Nicholson\'s part was more cartoon then character. (Quintisential Jack)! Costello should have been cast by a hungry unknown, (from Boston).What makes this very pretentious movie really bad, are the ""holes"". This movie leaked like a sieve. Allow me to address a few:1) The premise alone. You have a large police department investigating a large crime family, yet only three members, (one of which is not even out of the academy), will alone without the resources of the department infiltrate an organized mob presumably using a mole. 2) If costigan is suppose to have been dismissed from the force, then why is he being seen by a civil service police psychiatrist. 3) If costigan was pulled out of the academy specifically for the benefit of his anonymity, then why does everyone he meets, know him and his family. 4) Does the department acknowledge the existence of costigan or not? His entire identity can not be conveniently eliminated from all record and then later resurface for a meritorious award. 5) If Costello was an F.B.I. informant, were the hell were the F.B.I., and better yet, what bigger fish would the F.B.I. want, then Costello himself. 6) Speakng of other agencies, were the hell were the Boston police during all these inner city homicides going on inside their jurisdiction.The ending alone was most pathetic due to the fact there was no feasible conclusion possible based on the story\'s lack of continuity. I don\'t mind the enigmatic challenge of a smart and sophisticated screenplay, but please don\'t mollify me with vapid subplots.Too much budget, and not enough substance. Unfortunately, I seem to find the latter in only foreign or independent films. Hollywood needs to to produce more movies that don\'t just rely on its marquee. Next time the director calls, ""That\'s a wrap"", there should be no loose ends..', 'I beg you all, especially those who vote > 8, please view the trilogy of ""infernal Affair"" (Wu Jian Dao) from HK before doing any judgment on anyone in Departed.I personally favorite staff in the movie, Jack, Matt, Leo, Martin. I have to say all actors are the best, also, the script. Director, i am so disappointed.The story and even most charming details are borrowed from the original version(the first installation of the trilogy, if you are interested, the following two are also the most excellent movies in HK movie history), however, Martin turned me down finally.No discussion on the reasons why the two mouse come to be themselves, (it has been a long way why they ""departed""), please do not use only F-word to attract us, please don\'t regard everyone of us as fool. Matt is kind of no-brain to get all the info to Leo when they finally meet at the police office, and then became just a cold blood killer(still no-brain) to delete his files. is that make any sense, they looks like idiots there? Music is nice, but still a long way to the old one, which is much compatible to the atmosphere(which is also missing in this cut).And finally, the end is disappointed. where in the HK version, it is most exciting and moving 10 minutes during last 10 years. thanks!', ""Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock\x85'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite \x96 people started laughing.Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes \x96 almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already."", ""The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie.Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby.By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke.Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?"", ""I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original.The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen').To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide."", ""what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull"", 'I thought the original movie of it ""The Infernal Affairs"" was more entertaining than ""The Departed"". The Infernal Affairs had more actions and more emotional than The Departed. It was total copy cat of the Infernal Affairs. When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, ""Sorry, I\'m a police officer."" Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it\'s a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn\'t know how to act. They should of had Brad Pitt instead. The performance would be more outstanding. They got lots of cheap actors for The Departed. For the Infernal Affairs, they got a lot of expensive actors. GO INFERNAL AFFAIRS!!!', 'Idiots often say this: ""Oh, yes, it\'s very good for Hollywood I suppose, but not a patch on the Uruguayan original."" Well smack me in the face and call me an idiot, \'cos the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou) is aeons better than the Scorsese-directed, all-star Hollywood remake.The original was 100 minutes long and so taught you could probably play it like banjo strings. Several of the scenes were filmed with such artistry that they set a new standard in beautifully realised intensity. The plotting was tight, the acting pitch-perfect, and you really felt for the protagonists.It was, in short, the best cops and robbers thriller anyone had seen in years.So of course it had to be remade.Enter Scorsese, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Baldwin et al.What results is bloated competence.The set-pieces from Infernal Affairs remain, but are slacker and less well-handled. People in the cinema were laughing where they should have been clutching their heart to keep it in their chest.The precision camera-work gives way to run-of-the-mill shots. Consider the sloppy execution of the rooftop fall.The film is considerably longer without any real cause (bar, perhaps, Nicholson\'s hammy imperative to overplay any role he takes on). Witness the affair storyline, which is an unnecessary sop to the need for a more prominent female role, or the FBI addition, which is completely superfluous.The end result is simply a lot weaker than the tightly-budgeted, tightly-edited, subtler original.The only improvement \x96 and I shudder to say this \x96 is Alec Baldwin\'s role as the wise-cracking police captain, which made me chuckle on many occasions.Get the original out instead. Please. You won\'t regret it.', ""I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ******The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichÃ©d and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't"", 'OK, saw the movie actually 2 days ago, didn\'t get a chance to think about it. Now with a refreshed mind, here it goes:If one never saw the original ""Infernal Affairs"", you would fall in love with ""The Departed"" right away, after all it has an excellent plot. And with the legendary ""Gangs"" like Nicolson and Scorsese, we have every reason to have a high expectation. Unfortunately, this is not the case!The Bad: If I want to sum it up, I would say that was because of Scorsese\'s passion over brutal violence, it prevents him to reveal the true essence (as human beings) of the movie.1. I really feel sorry for Martin Sheen, his character in the movie is so pale, he does not show the deep and close relationship (as in the Infernal Affairs between Tony Leung and Anthony Wong), nor there was any sign shows he was even a capable cop. So unfortunately, I found myself hardly could feel sorry for what happened to him. Having said that,Infernal Affair\'s Anthony Wong did a superb job to catch the essence of his character. 2. OK, how about Mark Wahlberg\'s role? The obviously increased lines for him did not charm him a bit. With his boss being killed, and him as the only one knows about DiCaprio\'s true identity, he actually took a paid leave?! What\'s up with that? Does it even make a logically reasonable sense?! All right, he took his action in the end, but\x853. Does it have to be a two and half hours movie? There are so many unnecessary scenes to my opinion. Just name a simple one here: when Matt Damon went in talking to the bad guy pretending he is the lawyer. PLEASE! We audience are no fool, you don\'t need to show everything to us, all you need to do is send Damon to the room and start talking. We would figure out the guy\'s lawyer did not show up. Well, there are so many in the movie, what I am trying to say is if Scorsese wants us to keep thinking about what happens and what will happen next, you ought to do a consistent job!4. The most of all, this movie pretty much follows what the Infernal Affairs had to offer, the biggest shock? The ENDING! I have to say I was confused right after I saw the movie, I thought maybe I was too dumb to figure out what it meant. BUT, the more I think about it, the more I got disappointed. The ending was so bad it can literally take all the credits it gets. Let\'s set Mr. Scorsese\'s beloved violence scenes aside, for me, I think the essence for the movie is: the ""good"" and the ""bad"" does not really have a clear line in between to judge from. Just like Nicolson said: ""When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I\'m saying is this: When you\'re facing a loaded gun, what\'s the difference?"" For that reason, I gave two thumbs up for Infernal Affairs\' ending, sorry Scorsese, yours is just too lame!Also, I am not buying the cell phone communication throughout the movie, personally, I think the Morse code is a much better way!The Good: 1. Nicolson! To be honest, he is a perfect fit for this character. The only other possible candidate I can think of is Robert De Niro. Nicolson actually did a great job as Frank Costello. My only problem is I could hardly see Costello\'s foxy side. 2. The Shrink! OK, I have to say that is one shining point of the movie! Not like the original one assigned two female roles to the two leading actors, ""The Departed"" combines as one, which not only makes the character more standing out, but also adds another interesting twist to the story.', ""Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD).Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.b. the time-line.c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did? g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me to Production value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it."", 'Why does Hollywood continue to believe that people in this day and time need to hear cursing in movies that goes way out of line. The entire script was centered around who could use the F word the most in one sentence. I believe that the writer must believe that in order to be a ""real"" man that you have to curse. The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a ""real"" man. Don\'t try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do. I am a police officer and have been for over 35 years and have never heard anyone use the f word like it was used in this movie. The Massachusetts State Police hopefully are in a uproar over the way they are portrayed in this movie. It makes them look like a bunch of uneducated dunces that can only prove themselves to each other by cursing. Stay away from this movie.', ""Lets start with a very slow intro to an amazing story. Then lets compile a dream cast of characters to act out this amazing story. So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year. Then once this character had given up everything and risked his life in nearly every scene, lets FINALLY give him the opportunity to hand over the dirty cop and set things straight. Well, we don't have time to finish the story with a great ending, so lets just kill him. Then at the end, lets kill the dirty cop so he can be decorated as a hero instead of turning over evidence so he can be convicted. This could have been the best movie of the year, and the story could have been told in well under 2 hours. They should have just opened and closed with a firing squad and I could have been in and out in 10 minutes with the same results."", 'Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn\'t convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I\'m Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn\'t kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money\'s been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he\'d been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve\'s gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn\'t wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.', 'I wasn\'t surprised when it won. The ""oh, he/she has never won, so we\'ve got to give it to he/she"" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn\'t seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn\'t last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson\'s games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn\'t known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn\'t have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson\'s character wouldn\'t have fingered and killed DiCaprio\'s character quickly is also ridiculous. Let\'s see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren\'t sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn\'t a rat, why didn\'t he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn\'t killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won\'t believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a ""which one doesn\'t belong in this group"" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don\'t get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg\'s village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn\'t know how to tie his shoes?All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous.']",/posters/xThe.jpg

I could constantly guess what was going to happen at the end of certain action scenes, and don\'t even get me started about the helicopter scene... that one was supposed to be dramatic and some kind of fitting twist but just left me enraged at the stupidity of the screenwriters/adaptation.In the end it\'s quality is on par with the other 2 similar series (Divergent and Hunger Games), so, gets a 5 star ""meh"" out of me. Good for kids but intelligent people beware!', ""Simply put, this just isn't a good movie. So many crucial plot points just didn't make much sense and we not executed well at all. The opening scene was a classic example of where the protagonist can do no wrong, and all the antagonist have some of the worst aim and intellect of all time. The master plan was to board a ship that probably wouldn't even possibly be function able to sail to an unknown island that they somehow got word of without external knowledge. Thomas and co expected to break into the most heavily guarded place left on earth with literally no tools or knowledge to do so, and just for the plots sake got lucky enough to have just enough people crucial to the execution of the plan tag along in a very convenient time. If they hadn't have showed up when they did (in the tunnel) this movie could've ended 30 minuets in. Long story short, they team up with Gally, and somehow he knows how to get into a very heavily guarded city, as well as knows how to get someone onto a crane.There were SO many things wrong with their time in the city that it's a waste of time to write, but it's highlighted by how Brenda somehow drives a bus full of people around a city without getting quickly dismantled by police, and by how the bus gets picked up by a crane and dropped over a wall without any casualties. The end was a big disappointment to me, and there was no reason that Teresa couldn't have made it into the plane, that for some odd reason couldn't get 2-3 feet closer to the building. I understand why they killed her off, but it was just done clumsily. To top it all off, how long was Thomas asleep from a non-fatal gunshot wound? When he woke up, they were literally harvesting corn on a beach... but were still sleeping in hammocks. I guess they wanted watchers to assume he had been asleep for sometime or had been in a coma, but it seems like they just chose to throw logic out the door for one of the most important scenes in the whole series. All that being said, it had some good, entertaining scenes, but the story telling was too weak for this movie to be any better than mediocre."", 'Some of you guys have got to be kidding me. I\'ve been waiting so long for this movie but, man, did they blow it. Let\'s say the visual effects were alright, but the actors\' lines... it was like a watching cartoons for 2 year olds. ""Come on, let\'s go!"". That was like the main line of the movie. And the plot was not that well thought. Anyway, it is my opinion, rarely have I been so anxious for a movie to end in the theater, I\'m sorry but it terribly disappointed me. :(', 'If I would create a movie I would hire one person associated with this movie.

The second movie was awful and the third as well. There is just no logic in the entire movie. It could use some realism.

Then the bus scene... really??? 28 kids hanging upside down from a crane that needs to shove the bus over a brick wall defending the city... come on! And then all the ""i didn\'t see that coming moments"". This movie was just terrible to watch for 142 minutes and is the worst I\'ve seen in a year + its has nothing to do anymore with the title. Where is the fucking maze then? They should have just sticked to 1 movie. The first one was awesome.', ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure has strong special effects and many action scenes, but the lack of internal coherence makes it painful to watch. The film is full of absurdities from its first moments. To name only a few, an aerial gunship can't hit or disable a pickup truck, and a Glader somehow gets into cockpit of the operating enemy gunship without the pilot noticing until she points a gun at the pilot. The WCKD are painfully stupid one-dimensional dummies. Their troopers seem unable to hit anything with high-powered weapons. Later, WCKD Troopers with automatic weapons surrounding a bus with vehicles on all sides can't stop it. The Gladers quickly kill numerous WCKD troopers but there are numerous scenes where WCKD has opportunity to kill the Gladers but want them expect them to put their hands up and play nicely until they can overpower and escape. Over and over, Gladers virtually can't be hit or stopped where WCKD are totally incapable. These absurdities dispense of any suspense regarding how the film will turn out. Aiden Gillen, who was an intriguing character in GoT, here is reduced to a kind of Elmer Fudd-like villian, bumblingly stupid and incompetent beyond belief. It's a disgraceful script for a talented actor.The Gladers seemed to have no more ethics or morals than WCKD, and probably less. They had no qualms about killing and no concern for the larger society beyond their group of friends, whereas the WCKD doctor and researchers seemed to genuinely want to reverse the virus and help the citizenry to the extent possible.The hubris of this film's marathon length 2 hours 22 minutes made the series of absurdities excruciating, and it never got better. Whereas good sci-fi and fantasy films have enough internal consistency to engage the viewer, Maze Runner: The Death Cure had so many internal contradictions and problems that I was never able to suspend my disbelief long enough to find any enjoyment.If you aren't a dedicated longtime fan of the series, skip this one.

Needless to say the second and third movies are actual trash while the first has it\'s merits. \nThe first Maze Runner worked well enough because it only provided enough information to the audience required as well ASKING QUESTIONS. As soon as the series devolved into ""evil big company is putting kids in a maze for literally no reason so they can find a cure for a zombie virus"" it turned into something a middle schooler got a B- on. That\'s really sad considering I even got tiny feelings of ""Cube"", a cult classic of sci-fi death maze movies, during the first Maze Runner.With that preface out of the way how about I list off some fun little plot holes and inconsitencies that I could find within The Death Cure with some tying back to the first 2 movies. I\'ll try and go in order of appearance.1: 6 months supposedly has passed since the ending of Scorch Trials and start of Death Cure but for some reason WCKD is only just now transporting Minho and others from some unknown location to their headquarters.\n2: The plane they hijack is alone and lands for no reason when they corner Jorge and Brenda instead of just shooting them.\n3: Thomas is dead set on saving Minho, who he doesn\'t even know for sure is alive, and barely gives notice to Aris or the other people he could be saving. Also Aris and the rest make no apperances besides the first 15 minutes and ending.\n4: Minho is being tortured in a simulation, which he doesn\'t realize is fake for some reason, which begs the question why WCKD wasted massive amounts of time and resources building a huge maze when they displayed and admitted the simulation works. This also begs the question of why they wouldn\'t just treat the immune people very nicely so they would have no reason to care if they are being tested.\n5: Thomas, Fry and Newt drive slowly through a tunnel they are highly suspecting is full of zombies when they could easily have driven faster to avoid them.\n6: All other cities have been reduced to rubble but Jorge upon seeing the walls says they are new implying the city was still shining and fine before they raised the walls. If it wasn\'t shining and fine this implies enough people had resources to rebuild a ruined city to modern comfort.\n7: Thomas and other tagged people aren\'t trackable by that tag until it is convenient for the plot.\n8: Gally survived the ending of the first Maze Runner somehow even though he was infected and punctured through the lungs with a spear. This implies people arrived very shortly after Thomas and the others were flown away, removed the spear, performed surgery, and have been giving him serum for a minimum of 6 months. Gally may also be a cure considering a girl later in the movie was only infected for 3 weeks and still turned into a zombie even after serum injection. Nobody turned him over to WCKD for any profit when he was clearly a test subject. This is where I would have left the theatre.\n9: Thomas never considered that his blood was a cure 6 months after Brenda was treated because he is a moron. WCKD was apparently also full of complete morons to not realize Thomas was a cure before the events of the first Maze Runner.\n10: Gally was correct in that they did not need Teresa to enter WCKD HQ as they only needed her thumbprint. They could have done what he suggested and cut it off and saved themselves large issues while also maintaining her hostage. Thomas stopped him because he still had feelings for her even though she was the direct reason for Minho\'s capture as well as the deaths of many others.\n11: Gally, Thomas and Newt suddenly have WCKD security uniforms supposedly because Teresa acquired them to use but they still insist on bringing her along as well as stupidly removing their masks at one point.\n12: They raid the cell block but do not arm the immunes with the weapons of the guards they just took out as well as leaving Gally to retrieve the serum when Newt could have immediately used it upon acquisition. They also do not simply use the helicopter they have to extract the immunes under the pretense of guarded evacuation.\n13: Thomas and Newt have the opportunity to incapacitate or kill Janson while alone in the elevator but simply avoid suspicion even though it backfires. Teresa also locks them in later although she could have easily stated Thomas and Newt were in the elevator leading to their capture faster with less incident.\n14: Gally leaves to find Thomas and Newt but is revealed to have just been outside the building later.\n15: Thomas, Newt and Minho lock themselves in a room with a lock that should not exist, survive a jump from at least 5 stories into a pool they do not know the depth of with no injuries as well as Janson or the soldiers deciding not to shoot them when they have clear shots from a vantage point.\n16: The bus full of immunes driven by Brenda somehow makes it to exactly where it needs to be without being stopped as well as not falling soon after being lifted.\n17: Brenda and Fry return to the outcast hideout only to sit and do nothing even though the entire city is exploding in the distance.\n18: The outcasts destroy the entire city even though they wanted in and it does not benefit them in almost any way. They also could have entered the walls the same way Thomas, Gally and Newt entered earlier but were too stupid to do so.\n19: The helicopter Jorge flies in does not get shot down although there is no indication it isn\'t WCKD controlled. A scene of a different helicopter being shot down is shown later to confirm this could happen.\n20: Newt turns into a zombie even though outcasts clearly had access to serum they could have taken with them in case Newt started to turn. He also had the opportunity to disarm himself before turning but did not for no reason.\n21: Janson shoots Dr. Paige even though she would be a valuable scientist regardless of affiliation due to her knowledge on the virus. Also the bullet does not pass through her into Thomas.\n22: Janson has no qualms about killing either Teresa or Thomas even though they are both now very valuable to his plan of vaccine monopoly. They also do not threaten him with this fact\n23: The glass on the zombie enclosement does not shatter when missiles hammer the building but shatters on it\'s own when an injured Thomas hits it with a microscope.\n24: Thomas kisses Teresa and empathizes with her even though she was the direct reason many people were killed as well as Minho\'s capture.\n25: Teresa could have made the jump to the helicopter as she was not injured like Thomas. The argument about the helicopter not getting closer is somewhat defensible due to the massive heat updraft that would surround the building as well as wind splash off the roof possibly disrupting flight stabilization.\n26: Thomas carves Teresa\'s name on the rock although it would quickly be defaced as a portion of the people who died are also carved on the rock.\n27: Thomas is the potential cure for a zombie virus that has destroyed almost all of humanity but is now isolated with no evidence shown people have the knowledge to create a cure from his blood.PHEW, and that\'s just the stuff I could find easily. One of the few positive things to come out of this movie is how NOT to write things. The only reason I gave it a 2/10 is because of how nice some of the effects and sets are even though sadly they are in a trash movie.', ""Boring - i had to make huge effort to not fall asleep during the movie.\nEffects - it looks like the blow effects were made using the technology from the movie star wars from 1977.\nLogic - 0 **** was given during the thinking of this film. Its like in the beginning of the movie soldiers running towards the main character, and the maze runners have an army aircraft, so why the hell won't you shoot the enemy soldiers with this aircraft?\nLogic p2 - the runners arrive to a city wall, there they meet a resistance group, the leader of the group wants to take over the city so the poor people can enjoy good life too, but instead he sends his men to blow the city up.\nStory - the main character has the cure in his blood (surprise surprise) so what he does? he takes a group of all the immune with him to an isolated island. great!There were lots of other stupid parts in the movie. So my verdict, really crappy movie."", ""It's like this was written by 15 year olds... omg \nSooo slow for the first half and even with all the action in the second half it was dragged out way to long."", 'There is nothing surprising in this movie, except the 0 % accuracy of the enemy troops. You can anticipate what is going to happen, and even what they are going to say.', ""I just watched a Maze Runner marathon, the first two followed by the final instalment. Loved the first one, but hadn't seen the second one yet. I have to say, I didn't think that was anywhere near as bad as it was made out to be.\nThe third one though? Oh boy... Well, it actually starts out really well! Good action and our heroes are able to make a fist against WCKD in a very satisfying way. Unfortunately, the film ends up dragging on seemingly forever. I feel like at least half an hour could have been cut to make it much better. The second half of the film keeps getting more and more boring.\nThe biggest problem is that several of the most important characters are completely unbelievable. Janson (Gillen's character) especially seems to make no sense at all. \nThen there is a nagging feeling that the whole thing is completely pointless and our 'heroes' are actually wrong! Now that could be very interesting if done right, but the movie is presented entirely as a young adult good guys vs bad guys film and the fact that they may be wrong is not explored at all. If they'd just done nothing, the world would probably have been a better place, but the movie still pretends that they 'won' and everything is fine now.\nAlso, the motivations behind why these kids were put in the maze in the first place are barely explored. It's implied that the pressure is needed to trigger their immunity to grow (why that would be so is beyond me), but most of the kids just sat in the Glade peacefully for years.\nInstead of exploring those topics, the last half hour or so of the movie is spent watching characters melodramatically stare at each other while war rages around them, inevitably dying because they couldn't get over their teen angst long enough to actually save anyone (except Thomas, he has plot armor).\nThe film just left me feeling like I watched some dimwits that couldn't see the big picture and the survivors now sit on a beach pretending everything is okay (when most likely the infected will just catch up with them and they'll die because they're just sitting there in a couple of beach shacks)..."", ""If someone asked you to name something with the words: long, boring, predictable, and excruciating, then this movie would be perfect. I honestly felt like I was being tortured while watching this movie. The movie was unbelievably predictably along with a plot so boring it makes you wonder if the producers put any effort/creativity into this film. And not only that but they dragged out the movie by showing unnecessary drawn-out scenes that were obviously predictable which resulted into a combination of a lengthy and dull movie. If you're looking for an exciting movie to watch, then this isn't the one."", 'The first movie to this trilogy had an interesting gimmick: a dynamic maze filled with dangerous creatures. When this is removed, you take away the most interesting part of the movie. That is why the sequel performed so poorly in the box office. The second movie could be summarized as a bunch of bland characters walking on a desert. This third and final film is better than its predecessor, but that is not saying much.The plot boils down to a group of characters rescuing one of the friends, Minho, of the protagonist, Thomas, while some people work on the cure for a virus. The virus is of course as unoriginal as possible (it turns the infected into the stereotypical zombie). The plan to save Minho is ridiculous, it consists of putting him and other people immune to the virus in a bus, lift it with a crane from the inside of the city and drop it outside of the walls that border it. Of course, the bumpers must have been incredibly strong since they remain attached to the bus when it is lifted by the crane, plus the immune kids must also be invisible because none of them die or are hurt when the bus falls.I must say I have a couple of questions. Why do mainstream movies have to end with ""epic"" explosions? Why are the main characters always being shot at when they are running, but they are asked nicely to calm down and to surrender when they have nowhere to go until a deus ex machina appears? Why does the bad guy, the one trained to kill people, who has an army at his command armed to the teeth, playing catch up with a bunch of teenagers for 30 min? If the first five times when he almost caught them were not exciting, do you think the next twenty will be? Are we supposed to care about Teresa\'s death? Didn\'t the movie spend 2/3 of its time painting her in a bad light? You know, the untrustworthy chick? Where is the character arc? Where is the plot twist? The suspense?Apart from the weak story, the acting is mediocre, and the directing was full of problems too. Instead of the action being fluid, it is shot by sections making it look clumsy and awkward. For example, there is a scene where one of the good guys throws a grenade, but instead of being thrown and it exploding, there a shot of it being thrown, a show of it shown where it lands, a zoom in of the faces of the bad guys looking at each other worried because it is going to explode, it exploding from a different angle, and a shot of the good guys celebrating. This type of editing removes the fluidity of a shot and disconnects you from it. I could go on and one, but I think I made my point.However, if you liked the first and, specially, if you liked the second movie, I\'m pretty sure you will enjoy this one too!', 'When you can predict the next move in a scene that is supposed to be thrilling. It ain\'t so thrilling.\nThe movie was to long. It probably wouldn\'t hurt cutting it half hour shorter.\nThe villain ""Little finger"" was stuck in the Little finger role. \nI rated it 6 before I started writing the review, lowering it to 5.', ""Probably one of the least enjoyable movies I ever seen, the plot is not well thought through as they made Wicked the good guys and everyone else a primitive moron whoes sole purpose is to f### up everything until there is nothing left.The movie is clearly targeting people who only watch it cause it's the last one in the story and will love it due to all character intactions and the drama..... well no I can in no way possible imagine this movie costing over 60 millions to make and I only find relief in that it is finally over."", ""I cannot finish this movie,\nFrom the first 5 min of the movie, the very start, you already know it's gonna be bad, and i liked the first maze runner, and sorta enjoyed the second one.\nSo why is it that bad ?\nEvery god damn action is far fetched and obvious, there's no surprise, it feels like it's written by a child...\nFrom the awful enemy's aim that kindly avoid hurting the main cast because they're not allowed to perturb the story-line, to the cliche turn of even, every action leave a bitter taste. \nThe story main story might be great, but the detail are poorly written, which makes every scene difficult to believe in, and for that reason, it takes a lot of determination or stupidity to finish that movie."", 'First few at least had some sense of a plot, especial first episode (in spite of the constant ""acting direction"" given to Dylan O\'Brien... "" ...always use bewilderment...always pause before need to run from bad situation...always come in arms flaying and fall down..."" wow).So... transport train chase (and... why are they being transported?), trucks 100 mph chasing, but stop 2 meters from a prescribed pit with troops landing in desert, oh, and take said hover craft, but... don\'t use awesome machine guns...they didn\'t against ens of last movie with machine gun in a truck.... wow.\nAnd.... you got the wrong train car. wow.And... now there\'s the plot(?) wow. What writing.And least have things obey probability even in sci-fi. what writing.', 'First time that I had to leave the theaters! I would like a refund if it was a possible but anyway its a lesson to learn.', 'GarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbageGarbage']",/posters/xMaze.jpg
